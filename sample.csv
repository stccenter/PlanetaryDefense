The other articles in this volume demonstrate that the design and the optimisation of low-thrust trajectories are usually a very difficult task that involves much experience and expert knowledge. We have used evolutionary neurocontrol-a method that fuses artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms-to find a solution for the given low-thrust trajectory optimisation problem. This method requires less experience/knowledge in astrodynamics and in optimal control theory than the traditional methods. In this paper, the implementation of evolutionary neurocontrol is outlined and its performance for the given problem is shown. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The search for the globally optimal, low-thrust, gravity-assist trajectory for maximally deflecting an asteroid is performed in two steps. The first step involves a rough global search of the global search space, which has, however, been somewhat bounded based on prior mission-design experience, intuition, and energy arguments. A shape-based method is used to represent the low-thrust arcs, while the ballistic portions are searched almost exhaustively. The second step involves local optimisation of trajectories which stand out from the rough global search. The low-thrust optimisation problem is turned into a parameter optimisation problem by approximating the continuous thrusting as a series of impulsive manoeuvres. Of the many trajectories found, three optimal trajectories are reported and compared, including the one submitted for the competition. The best one employed a double-Venus, quadruple-Earth, Jupiter-Saturn-Jupiter gravity-assist sequence. The trajectory submitted for the competition used one less Venus flyby and one less Earth flyby.

Adding these NEAs to our previous results we now count 739 program NEAs followed-up by the EURONEAR network since 2006. The targets were selected using EURONEAR planning tools focusing on high priority objects. Analyzing the resulting orbital improvements suggests astrometric follow-up is most important days to weeks after discovery, with recovery at a new opposition also valuable. Additionally we observed 40 survey fields spanning three nights covering 11 square degrees near opposition, using the Wide Field Camera on the 25 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), resulting in 104 discovered main belt asteroids (MBAs) and another 626 unknown one-night objects. These fields, plus program NEA fields from the INT and from the wide field MOSAIC II camera on the Blanco 4 m telescope, generated around 12000 observations of 2000 minor planets (mostly MBAs) observed in 34 square degrees. We identify Near Earth Object (NEO) candidates among the unknown (single night) objects using three selection criteria. Testing these criteria on the (known) program NEAs shows that the best selection method is our e-it model which checks solar elongation and sky motion and the MPCs NEO rating tool. Our new data show that on average 0.5 NEO candidates per square degree should be observable in a 2 m-class survey (in agreement with past results), while an average of 2.7 NEO candidates per square degree should be observable in a 4 m-class survey (although our Blanco statistics were affected by clouds). At opposition just over 100 MBAs (1.6 unknown to every 1 known) per square degree are detectable to R=22 in a 2 m survey based on the INT data (in accordance with other results), while our two best ecliptic Blanco fields away from opposition lead to 135 MBAs (2 unknown to every 1 known) to R=23.

Because of their better performance for orbital debris, it has been thought by some that perhaps innovative techniques could allow radars to match or exceed the performance of optical telescopes for NEO searches. Past work has already demonstrated that radar is a valuable tool in NEO research in areas of orbit determination, size, shape, and surface characterization. This paper will show that another 5-10 dB in S/N would be required above what is now available in the world''s most sensitive radars to achieve reasonable detection rates.

We compare the errors and convergence rates of the standard and compatible SPH formalisms on a variety of shock test problems with analytic answers. We find that the new compatible formalism reliably achieves the expected first-order convergence for these analytic shock tests and, in all cases, improves the accuracy of the numerical solution over the standard formalism. We also examine the performance of our new formalism on a more complicated applied problem: the diversion of an asteroid by a kinetic impactor. We find the compatible discretization demonstrates measurable improvement in the convergence of properties such as the deflection velocity in this kind of applied problem as well.

The implementation of CCD on a Shmidt telescope has started CCD based projects for detection of the potentially dangerous asteroids and for providing a better estimate of the current near Earth object population. The observations have been performed by the Shmidt telescope (50/70), while for the case of fainter objects (m greater than or equal to 13), they will be performed with Ritchey - Cretien (diameter 2 m) telescope with Photometrics CCD camera (1024x1024 pr).",16,,1999,,,,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Apostolovska, G., Ivanova, V., Mijatovic, M. and Radeva, V., 1999.

To decrease the cost of software development and maintenance, this paper presents a generic pushbroom sensor model for planetary photogrammetry. Thus, various coordinate transformations can be conducted in a unified and efficient way, without considering the specific camera and the optical distortion equations. In terms of implementation, the camera file and orientation data file designed for the airborne linear array camera ADS40 are used to manage the interior orientation and exterior orientation parameters of planetary images. The generic pushbroom sensor model supports the summing mode, varying exposure times within an image and image distortions, which are typical problems in need of a solution in planetary mapping. Furthermore, an alternative photogrammetric process based on extracting tie points on approximate orthophotos is developed. The geometric accuracy and computational efficiency of the generic pushbroom sensor model were compared with the popular planetary cartographic softwareí¢â‚¬-Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed generic pushbroom sensor model can (1) deliver the same geometric accuracy as the ISIS pushbroom sensor model, (2) greatly improve the computational efficiency of orthophotos generation and tie points extraction, and (3) support various types of planetary remote sensing images. Moreover, the proposed generic pushbroom sensor model reduces the cost of software development because different types of planetary images share the same code base.",,3,2020,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA001014,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019EA001014,Earth and Space Science,"Geng, X., Xu, Q., Xing, S. and Lan, C., 2020.

NASA plans to provide the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission which will perform a kinetic impactor experiment to demonstrate asteroid impact hazard mitigation. ESA proposes to provide the Hera mission which will rendezvous with the target to monitor the deflection, perform detailed characterizations, and measure the DART impact outcomes and momentum transfer efficiency. The primary goals of AIDA are (i) to demonstrate the kinetic impact technique on a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid and (ii) to measure and characterize the deflection caused by the impact. The AIDA target will be the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos, which is of spectral type Sq, with the deflection experiment to occur in October, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the binary at similar to 6 km/s changes the orbital speed and the binary orbit period, which can be measured by Earth-based observatories with telescope apertures as small as 1 m. The DART impact will in addition alter the orbital and rotational states of the Didymos binary, leading to excitation of eccentricity and libration that, if measured by Hera, can constrain internal structure of the target asteroid. Measurements of the DART crater diameter and morphology can constrain target properties like cohesion and porosity based on numerical simulations of the DART impact.",66,8,2018,10.1016/j.pss.2018.02.015,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2018.02.015,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Cheng, A.

Planetary defense is usually assumed to have the primary goal of maximizing the number of lives saved, but it can be argued that more emphasis should be placed on maximizing the probability of saving lives. For the latter goal, it is far more effective to create an early warning and civil defense plan than a mitigation plan that involves deflecting a large NEO. Because early warning and civil defense will almost certainly be needed long before the first deflection is ever required, the credibility of the planetary defense community and its recommendations will be put to its first serious test by an airburst Successful response to an airburst event will make it much more likely that recommendations for mitigation by deflection will be accepted by decision makers and the public. Focusing more attention on the second goal will, as a side effect, benefit the primary goal. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The motivation of designing this architectural framework is the current lack of structured architecture for the process of detecting, characterizing and mitigating these NEO threats. Due to the recent establishment of the NASA''s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO), it is critical to link the individual facilities conducting separate research with an objective of forming a clearly defined collaborative system based on data reporting and sharing. The architectural framework is designed for integrating the process of detecting, characterizing and mitigating NEO threats. The goal of designing the architecture is to organize current data and resources into useful information and correlate that information with the goals of the NEO mitigation study. The architectural framework will enable scientists, organizations, and decision makers to locate, identify and resolve semantic confusion, properties, facts, constraints and issues with potentially hazardous asteroids. Our major focus is to design the data and information flow that models the complete process from NEO detection, to designing the mitigation strategies. A secondary focus is to develop a systemof-systems architecture to describe the supporting infrastructure for the framework. The framework is also built with the opportunity to leverage future assets from the broader Planetary Defense (PD) community, and identify/speed up relevant PD research and response.",22,,2017,,,,Engineering,"Yang, C.P., Yu, M., Xu, M., Jiang, Y., Qin, H., Li, Y., Bambacus, M., Leung, R.Y., Barbee, B.W., Nuth, J.A. and Seery, B., 2017, March.

Computation of the orbital evolution of this object is limited by insufficient knowledge of physical properties required to determine the role played by non-gravitational effects. Using polarimetric observations, we have obtained the first reliable determination of the albedo of Apophis, obtaining 0.33 +/- 0.08. We also derive an updated estimate of the asteroid''s absolute magnitude: H = 19.7 +/- 0.4. Using this albedo and H, we find that Apophis has a diameter of 270 60 m, slightly smaller than preliminary estimates based upon an assumed albedo. Our observations demonstrate the feasibility of polarimetric observations aimed at obtaining albedos and sizes of small. potentially hazardous asteroids. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Swift target-of-opportunity observations in 2017 show even stronger fading in the soft X-rays compared to the ROSAT detection of this source in 1995, with at least a factor of 15 decrease. We obtained second-epoch spectroscopy with the Palomar telescope in 2017 that, when compared with the 2006 archival SDSS spectrum, reveals that the broad H beta emission has vanished and that the quasar has become significantly redder. The two most likely interpretations for this dramatic change are source fading or obscuration, where the latter is strongly disfavored by the mid-IR data. We discuss various physical scenarios that could cause such changes in the quasar luminosity over this timescale, and favor changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk that occur on the thermal and heating/cooling front timescales. We discuss possible physical triggers that could cause these changes, and predict the multiwavelength signatures that could distinguish these physical scenarios.",85,9,2018,10.3847/1538-4357/aac726,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aac726,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Stern, D., McKernan, B., Graham, M.J., Ford, K.E.S., Ross, N.P., Meisner, A.M., Assef, R.J., Baloković, M., Brightman, M., Dey, A. and Drake, A., 2018.

In this paper we present a comparative assessment of some of the more feasible mitigation schemes reviewed in the literature (i.e. solar collector, nuclear blast, kinetic impactor, low-thrust propulsion and mass driver). For each strategy, a multi-criteria optimization method has been used to construct a set of Pareto optimal solutions, minimizing both the mass of the spacecraft and the warning time, while simultaneously maximizing the deviation. A dominance criterion has then been defined and used to compare all the Pareto sets. The achievable deviation at the MOID, either for a low-thrust or for an impulsive maneuver, has been computed through a set of analytical formulas. The variation in the orbit of the NEO has been estimated through a deviation action model that takes into account the wet mass of the spacecraft on the Earth. Finally the technology readiness level of each strategy has been used to recompute a more realistic value for the required warning time.",35,,2007,,,,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics,"Sanchez Cuartielles, J.P., Colombo, C., Vasile, M. and Radice, G., 2007, February.

A particular deflection technique, employing a swarm of mirrors focusing the light of the Sun on the surface of the asteroid, is described. The swarm has to fly in formation with the asteroid, or hover in close proximity. The paper describes two different designs for the mirrors, and different options to place the spacecraft in the vicinity of the asteroid. In particular the paper shows a number of periodic formation orbits. As an alternative, results are shown by placing the spacecraft at fixed points in close proximity to the asteroid, where the solar pressure and the gravity attraction balance each other.

But we lack direct knowledge of the geophysical behavior of an asteroid surface under milligravity conditions, and therefore landing on an asteroid and manipulating its surface material remains a daunting challenge. Towards this goal we are putting forth plans for a 12U CubeSat that will be in Low Earth Orbit and that will operate as a spinning centrifuge on-orbit. In this paper, we will present an overview of the systems engineering and instrumentation design on the spacecraft. Parts of this 12U CubeSat will contain a laboratory that will recreate asteroid surface conditions by containing crushed meteorite. The laboratory will spin at 1 to 2 RPM during the primary mission to simulate surface conditions of asteroids 2 km and smaller, followed by an extended mission where the spacecraft will spin at even higher RPM. The result is a bed of realistic regolith, the environment that landers and diggers and maybe astronauts will interact with. The CubeSat is configured with cameras, lasers, actuators and small mechanical instruments to both observe and manipulate the regolith at low simulated gravity conditions. A series of experiments will measure the general behavior, internal friction, adhesion, dilatancy, coefficients of restitution and other parameters that can feed into asteroid surface dynamics simulations. Effective gravity can be varied, and external mechanical forces can be applied. These centrifuge facilities in space will require significantly less resources and budget to maintain, operating in LEO, compared to the voyages to deep space. This means we can maintain a persistent presence in the relevant deep space environment without having to go there. Having asteroid-like centrifuges in LEO would serve the important tactical goal of preparing and maintaining readiness, even when missions are delayed or individual programs get cancelled.",38,,2019,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8741839,Engineering,"Thangavelautham, J., Asphaug, E. and Schwartz, S., 2019, March.

The interest in asteroid missions for the scientific exploration and near-Earth object (NEO) hazard mitigation has been increasing ever since the last two decades. The studies on attitude dynamics of spacecraft around asteroids are necessary for the design of the attitude control system. In this paper, the full nonlinear attitude dynamics of a rigid spacecraft on a stationary orbit around a uniformly-rotating asteroid is analyzed via the canonical Hamiltonian formalism and the dynamical systems theory. The nonlinear equations of attitude motion are obtained by Hamilton''''s canonical equations, in which the perturbations due to the gravity gradient torque and the precession of the orbital frame are both considered. A numerical method using a kind of generalized Poincare section is then utilized to investigate the dynamical behavior of the nonlinear equations of attitude motion. The generalized Poincare section technique is used to trace differences between the torque-free attitude motion and the gravity-gradient-perturbed motion. The effects of the coefficients C-20 and C-22 of the non-central gravity field of the asteroid are especially concerned. We find that under the perturbation of the gravity gradient torque, the attitude motion is significantly chaotic. We also find that due to the non-central gravity field of the asteroid, the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft is modified significantly in comparison with the classical attitude dynamics on a circular orbit in a central gravity field.

Like many other large families, it is associated with a ''''halo'''' of objects, that extends far beyond the boundary of the core family, as detected by traditional hierarchical clustering methods (HCM) in proper element domains. Numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of family members may help in estimating the family and halo family age, and the original ejection velocity field. But, in order to minimize the errors associated with including too many interlopers, it is important to have good estimates of family membership that include available data on local asteroid taxonomy, geometrical albedo and local dynamics. For this purpose, we obtained synthetic proper elements and frequencies of asteroids in the Hygiea orbital region, with their errors. We revised the current knowledge on asteroid taxonomy, including Sloan Digital Sky Survey-Moving Object Catalog 4th release (SDSS-MOC 4) data, and geometric albedo data from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Near-Earth Object WISE (NEOWISE). We identified asteroid family members using HCM in the domain of proper elements (a, e, sin(i)) and in the domains of proper frequencies most appropriate to study diffusion in the local web of secular resonances, and eliminated possible interlopers based on taxonomic and geometrical albedo considerations. To identify the family halo, we devised a new hierarchical clustering method in an extended domain that includes proper elements, principal components PC1, PC2 obtained based on SDSS photometric data and, for the first time, WISE and NEOWISE geometric albedo. Data on asteroid size distribution, light curves and rotations were also revised for the Hygiea family. The Hygiea family is the largest group in its region, with two smaller families in proper element domain and 18 families in various frequencies domains identified in this work for the first time. Frequency groups tend to extend vertically in the (a, sin (i)) plane and cross not only the Hygiea family but also the near C-type families of Themis and Veritas, causing a mixture of objects all of relatively low albedo in the Hygiea family area. A few high-albedo asteroids, most likely associated with the Eos family, are also present in the region. Finally, the new multidomains hierarchical clustering method allowed us to obtain a good and robust estimate of the membership of the Hygiea family halo, quite separated from other asteroids families halo in the region, and with a very limited (about 3 per cent) presence of likely interlopers.",33,6,2013,10.1093/mnras/stt437,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt437,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Carruba, V., 2013.

These concepts have been realized in SIRII (Space-based IR-imaging interferometer), a new light-weight, compact SWIR and MWIR imaging interferometer designed for space-based surveillance. The sensor design is configured as a six-element Fizeau interferometer; it is scalable, light-weight, and uses structural components and main optics made of carbon fiber replicated polymer (CFRP) that are easy to fabricate and inexpensive. A three-element prototype of the SIRII imager has been constructed. The optics, detectors, and interferometric signal processing principles draw on experience developed in ground-based astronomical applications designed to yield the highest sensitivity and resolution with cost-effective optical solutions. SIRII is being designed for technical intelligence from geo-stationary orbit. It has an instantaneous 6 x 6 mrad FOV and the ability to rapidly scan a 6x6 deg FOV, with a minimal SNR. The interferometric design can be scaled to larger equivalent filled aperture, while minimizing weight and costs when compared to a filled aperture telescope with equivalent resolution.

AoES are designed to operate in proximity to, and on the surface of, small asteroids to support mining and planetary defense missions. Their unique design and capabilities are dependent on the incorporation of soft, compliant, and lightweight materials. AoES have a large area-to-mass ratio which allows them to take advantage of the peculiarities of the dynamical environment around small asteroids. Specifically, AoES will use solar radiation pressure to sail to the surface of the target asteroid after being deployed at a safe altitude from a mothership around the asteroid. This capability and the associated control laws will be demonstrated, removing the need for propulsion systems. Furthermore, the large, flexible surface area allows for robustness with respect to uncertainty about the asteroid surface structure - it can provide flotation to prevent sinking into a very loose, dusty regolith, and also provide anchoring to the surface through natural and electroadhesion forces. The enabling technology that will allow the AoES design loop to close is a new class of soft actuators known as HASEL actuators. These actuators harness an electrohy-draulic mechanism, whereby electrostatic forces generate hydraulic pressure to drive shape change in a soft fluid-filled structure. HASELs provide an extremely power- and mass-efficient mechanism for actuating the large flexible surface areas that are the essential components defining AoES. Current system design, requirements, and key trade-offs will be discussed - with a particular focus on the actuation, mobility, anchoring, materials, and power systems/components. The nominal mission profile and concept of operations for using AoES in an asteroid mining mission will be outlined.",37,,2019,,,,Engineering,"McMahon, J., Mitchell, S.K., Oguri, K., Kellaris, N., Kuettel, D., Keplinger, C. and Bercovici, B., 2019, March.

The principle goal of the LCROSS mission was to shed light on the nature of the materials contained within permanently shadowed lunar craters. These Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) are of considerable interest due to the very low temperatures, < 120 K, found within the shadowed regions (Paige et al. 2010a, 2010b) and the possibility of accumulated, cold-trapped volatiles contained therein. Two previous lunar missions, Clementine and Lunar Prospector, have made measurements that indicate the possibility of water ice associated with these PSRs. LCROSS used the spent LRO Earth-lunar transfer rocket stage, an Atlas V Centaur upper stage, as a kinetic impactor, impacting a PSR on 9 October 2009 and throwing ejecta up into sunlight where it was observed. This impactor was guided to its target by a Shepherding Spacecraft (SSC) which also contained a number of instruments that observed the lunar impact. A campaign of terrestrial ground, Earth orbital and lunar orbital assets were also coordinated to observe the impact and subsequent crater and ejecta blanket. After observing the Centaur impact, the SSC became an impactor itself. The principal measurement goals of the LCROSS mission were to establish the form and concentration of the hydrogen-bearing material observed by Lunar Prospector, characterization of regolith within a PSR (including composition and physical properties), and the characterization of the perturbation to the lunar exosphere caused by the impact itself.",50,5,2012,10.1007/s11214-012-9880-6,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-012-9880-6,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Colaprete, A., Elphic, R.C., Heldmann, J. and Ennico, K., 2012.

99,J,POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW,t,US National Science and Technology Council on Impacts of Near-Earth Objects,Editorial Material,[Anonymous],[Anonymous],,,,,"The Trump Administration has been broadly indifferent to advice from the scientific community, a stance underlined by its long delay in filling the statutory post of science adviser to the President. The Administration has sought to scale back government funding of research in many areas of science and technology, notably on climate change. An exception to these cuts, apparently justified by a potentially more dramatic connection to homeland security, is the case of impact risks of near-earth objects (NEOs). In June 2018, a working group of the National Science and Technology Council issued a brief report, titled National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, setting out US goals for detecting and tracking NEOs, developing deflection technologies, and recovering from impacts. (The actual work envisaged is seen as largely being undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has had a long-running program on NEOs.) Initial sections of the report are reprinted below. The report offers estimates of the number and size distribution of NEOs thus far detected, in a chart that also marks the three best-known actual impacts: Chelyabinsk (20m), Tunguska (50m), and Chicxulub (10km). For American readers, it helpfully transposes Tunguska to New York City. It does not estimate average impact intervals or compare expected fatalities with other risks of death. This was done in a National Research Council report from 2010 (see the Documents section of PDR 36, no. 4). A Tunguska-level event might be expected every 2000 years or so, a Chelyabinsk every century or two. Expected deaths per year-admittedly a highly skewed distribution-were around 100, an order of magnitude greater than those from shark attacks but three orders less than from earthquakes.",2,9,2018,,,,Demography; Sociology,"[Anonymous], (2018).

Moreover, the statistics on asteroid spin rate and pole orientation are also important to understand how rotational status was affected by various mechanisms (e.g., mutual collision, tidal force and the YORP effect). To have a comprehensive study on the aforementioned questions, it relies on a large sample of asteroid rotation. Therefore, we initiated our cross-strait bilateral cooperation with the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) to collect asteroid light curves using the CNEOST (Chinese Near-Earth Object Survey Telescope) at XuYi station. A pilot survey of-40 square degrees using 8-min cadence had been carried out during February 27-March 2 2017. 1650 light curves were collected, from which 79 highly reliable rotation periods were derived.

112,J,SOLAR SYSTEM RESEARCH,t,Approximation of the observed motion of bolides by the analytical solution of the equations of meteor physics,Article,"Gritsevich, M","Gritsevich, M. I.",Moscow MV Lomonosov State University,Russia,,,"A great volume of data has been accumulated thus far related to the photoregistration of the paths of meteor bodies in the terrestrial atmosphere. Most images have been obtained by four bolide networks, which operate in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Spain in different time periods. The approximation of the actual data using theoretical models makes it possible to achieve additional estimates, which do not directly follow from the observations. In the present study, we suggest an algorithm to find such parameters of the theoretical relationship between the height and the velocity of the bolide motion that help to fit observations along the luminous part of the trajectories in the best way. The main difference from previous studies is that the given observations are approximated using the analytical solution of the equations of meteor physics. The model presented in this study was applied to a number of bright meteors observed by the Canadian camera network and by the US Prairie network and to the Benesov bolide, which is one of the largest fireballs registered by the European network. The correct mathematical modeling of meteor events in the atmosphere is necessary for further estimates of the key parameters, including the extra-atmospheric mass, the ablation coefficient, and the effective enthalpy of evaporation of entering bodies. In turn, this information is needed by some applications, namely, those aimed at studying the problems of asteroid and comet security, to develop measures of planetary defense, and to determine the bodies that can reach Earth''''s surface.",7,11,2007,10.1134/S003809460706007X,,http://doi.org/10.1134/S003809460706007X,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Gritsevich, M.I., 2007.

To effectively prepare such a mission, a robotic precursor should visit the asteroid target(s) to ensure its relevance and safety. This study describes the architecture, trajectory and system design of a precursor mission. Using low-thrust propulsion for multi-rendezvous approaches to Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), this mission named SESAME (Spacecraft for Evaluation of Suitability of Asteroids for Manned Exploration) is the first multi-targets precursor mission towards NEAs. A comparison of the lists of accessible targets for human spaceflight with the trajectories from the 5th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC5) is presented. GTOC5 trajectories are highly optimized, low thrust trajectories reaching multiple (up to 18) NEAs. However, the low correlation between the lists makes them unusable for a precursor mission and a new trajectory was computed. The outcome was a trajectory with a departure in 2023 reaching seven asteroids in less than 10 years (all in the top 25 of the Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS)). To comply with this trajectory, the final design focused on payload, propulsion, communication and power subsystems resulted in a precursor spacecraft reaching the first five targets of the trajectory: 2001 QJ142, 2000 SG344, 2009 OS5, 2007 YF and 1999 AO10. SESAME carries five 27.6 kg landers each having a short term observation function and a long term beacon function to guide the future crew. The spacecraft is powered by two 17 m(2) solar arrays and its propulsion system consists of three RIT-22 ion engines (one redundant). It uses Ka-band for the downlink communication to Earth. The total fuel mass of 576 kg consists of 451 kg of xenon for the ion propulsion and 125 kg of bi-propellant for the attitude control thrusters. The total launch mass is 1571 kg, well within the capabilities of current launchers. Finally, the results of a sensitivity analysis of the design evaluating the impact of changes in the Delta V required for the maneuvers at each target, in the power supply and in the dry mass are presented. SESAME represents a feasible spacecraft capable of reaching five of the most promising NEAs in less than seven years, with an average of five months of operation at each target.",54,,2013,,,,Engineering,"Marchand, E., 2013, March.

Among those bodies, mainly asteroids and comets, there are those that have the potential to create large scale destruction upon impact. The only extinction-level impact recorded to date was 65 million years ago, during the era of dinosaurs. The probability of another extinction-level, or even city-killer, impact may be negligible, but the consequences can be severe for the biosphere and for our species. Therefore it is highly imperative for us to be prepared for such a devastating impact in the near future, especially since humanity is at the threshold of wielding technologies that allow us to do so. Majority of scientists, engineers, and policymakers have focused on long-term strategies and warning periods for Earth orbit crossing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), and have suggested methods and policies to tackle such problems. However, less attention has been paid to short warning period NEO threats. Such NEOs test current technological and international cooperation capabilities in protecting ourselves, and can create unpredictable devastation ranging from local to global scale. The most recent example is the Chelyabinsk incident in Russia. This event has provided a wakeup call for space agencies and governments around the world towards establishing a Planetary Defense Program. The Roadmap for EArth Defense Initiative (READI) is a project by a team of international, intercultural, and interdisciplinary participants of the International Space University''''s Space Studies Program 2015 hosted by Ohio University, Athens, OH proposing a roadmap for space agencies, governments, and the general public to tackle NEOs with a short warning before impact. Taking READI as a baseline, this paper presents a technical description of methodologies proposed for detection and impact mitigation of a medium-sized comet (up to 800m across) with a short-warning period of two years on a collision course with Earth. The hypothetical comet is on a highly-inclined orbit having a high probability for Earth impact after its perihelion. For detection, we propose a space-based infrared detection system consisting of two satellites located at the Earth-Moon Lagrange points L1 and L2 coupled with space observatories, like the James Webb telescope and the Centennial telescope. These telescopes are supported by ground-based telescopes, like the Arecibo and Green Bank telescope, in the search for NEOs. Upon detection, the comet is tracked constantly using space-and ground-based telescopes. The deflection system is two-pronged,firstly involving the use of a high energy Directed Energy Laser Terminals (DELT) placed at Sun-Earth Lagrange points L4 and L5 so as to initiate and increase the ablation rate of the comet and deviate it from its collision trajectory, and secondly by the Hypervelocity Comet Intercept Vehicle (HCIV), a space-borne system combining a kinetic impactor with a thermonuclear device. The policy and international collaboration aspects to implement these methods are also outlined in the paper. The techniques mentioned could also be applied to mitigate medium-to-large sized asteroids (up to 2km across).",30,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Nambiar, S.P., Hussein, A., Silva-Martinez, J., Reinert, J. and Gonzalez, F., 2016, March.

Nuclear-Pumped Laser (NPL) technology was a part of the strategic defense initiative (SDI) program in the 1980''''s. NPLs have since faded from the United States research agenda but they remain an active part of the research agenda in other countries, notably in Russia and other nations in the former Soviet Union as well as China [1] which has a cooperative agreement with Russia [2]. The reason for this broad interest in the technology is that a NPL can scale to high power/energy levels (potentially up to 100 MW Continuous Wave (CW) beam power). Military applications have historically dominated the NPL research agenda. However, there are significant humanitarian applications for high power/energy lasers. For example a high power CW NPL would have the capability to deflect asteroids or comets. Other important applications are in space propulsion, power transmission, and asteroid mining. Despite the promise, there are significant problems in NPL development [3, 4]. High power/high energy gas lasers by their nature require high pumping power densities (defined as the Watts/cm(3) deposited in the laser medium). That is why many of the most powerful gas lasers are pulsed. Nuclear-pumping does not generate high power densities as compared to electrical pumping, but it does generate high energy densities. This limits the type of high power/high energy gas laser systems that can be driven by NPL technologies. Other issues involve the size and scale of NPLs using gas laser technology as well as the design of reactor cores dedicated to the production of laser beams. Several promising approaches were developed including the development of nuclear-driven flashlamps [5] which can increase the effective pumping power density through photon focusing and thus open up new possibilities for both gaseous and solid-state high power/high energy laser systems.",46,,2014,,,,Education & Educational Research; Engineering,"Prelas, M.A., Wattermann, M.L., Wisniewski, D.A., Neher, J.A. and Missouri, C.M., 2014.

Other uncertainties regard estimated mass, composition, and structural integrity of the NEO body. At issue is if one can reliably estimate a NEO threat and its magnitude. Parameters that determine NEO deflection requirements within various time frames, including the terminal orbital pass before impact, and necessary energy payloads, are quantitatively discussed. Propulsion system requirements for extending space capabilities to rapidly interact with NEOs at ranges of up to about 1AU (astronomical unit) from Earth are outlined. Such missions, without gravitational boosts, are deemed critical for a practical and effective response to mitigation. If an impact threat is confirmed on an immediate orbital pass, the option for interactive reconnaissance, and interception, and subsequent NEO orbit deflection must be promptly carried out. There also must be an option to abort the mitigation mission if the NEO is subsequently found not to be Earth threatening. These options require optimal decision latitude and operational possibilities for NEO threat removal while minimizing alarm. Acting too far in advance of the projected impact could induce perturbations that ultimately exacerbate the threat. Given the dilemmas, uncertainties, and limited options associated with timely NEO mitigation within a decision making framework, currently available propulsion technologies that appear most viable to carry out a NEO interception/mitigation mission within the greatest margin of control and reliability are those based on a combined (bimodal) nuclear thermal/nuclear electric propulsion platform. Elements of required and currently available performance characteristics for nuclear and electric propulsion systems are also discussed.",31,,2004,10.1196/annals.1311.019,,http://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1311.019,Engineering; Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Remo, J.L., 2004.

As part of this mission, the NASA-led Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will make a kinetic impactor collide with the smaller secondary of Didymos to test kinetic impact asteroid deflection technology, while the ESA-led Hera mission will evaluate the efficiency of the deflection by conducting detailed on-site observations. Research has shown that the larger primary of Didymos is spinning close to its critical spin, and the DART-impact-driven ejecta would give kinetic energy to the primary. It has been hypothesized that such an energy input might cause structural deformation of the primary, affecting the mutual orbit period, a critical parameter for assessing the kinetic impact deflection by the DART impactor. A key issue in the previous work was that the secondary was assumed to be spherical, which may not be realistic. Here, we use a second-order inertia-integral mutual dynamics model to analyze the effects of the shapes of the primary and the secondary on the mutual orbit period change of the system. We first compare the second-order model with three mutual dynamics models, including a high-order inertia-integral model that takes into account the detailed shapes of Didymos. The comparison tests show that the second-order model may have an error of similar to 10% for computing the mutual orbit period change, compared to the high-order model. We next use the second-order model to analyze how the original shape and shape deformation change the mutual orbit period. The results show that when the secondary is elongated, the mutual orbit period becomes short. Also, shape deformation of the secondary further changes the mutual orbit period. A better understanding of this mechanism allows for detailed assessment of DART''''s kinetic impact deflection capability for Didymos. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recent modelling of previously reported associations suggests that the time-scales to keep the orbital coherence of these streams producing meteorites are too short. We present an unequivocal association between near earth object (NEO) 2002NY40 and at least one bright fireball detected over Finland in 2006 August. Another two additional fireballs recorded from Spain and Finland seem to be related, together producing a fireball-producing stream (beta Aquarids). On the basis of historical data, the 2006 finding suggests the existence of a meteoroid complex capable of producing meteorites. Taking into account present time-scales for orbital decoherence, if 2002NY40 has large meteoroids associated with it, such behaviour would be the consequence of a relatively recent asteroidal fragmentation. Supporting our claim, the heliocentric orbits of two recently discovered NEOs, 2004NL8 and 2002NY40, were found to exhibit a good similarity to each other and also to the orbits of the three bolides. The fireball spectra of the two Finish bolides showed that the chemical abundances of these objects are consistent with the main elements found in chondrites. This result is consistent with the probable Low iron, Low metal (LL) chondritic mineralogy of asteroid 2002NY40. Consequently, this asteroid may be delivering LL chondrites to the Earth.

Although subsequent observations have substantially reduced the probability of a collision, it has not been ruled out; moreover, similar-sized asteroids in orbits intersecting the Earth''s orbit may well be discovered in the near future. We conduct a numerical simulation of an atmospheric passage and an impact on the Earth''s surface of a stony cosmic body with a diameter of 300 m and kinetic energy of about 1000 Mt, which roughly corresponds to the parameters of the asteroid Apophis, at atmospheric entry angles of 90A degrees (vertical stroke), 45A degrees, and 30A degrees. The simulation is performed by solving three-dimensional equations of hydrodynamics and radiative transfer equations in the approximations of radiative heat conduction and volume emission. The following hazards are considered: an air shock wave, ejecta from the crater, thermal radiation, and ionospheric disturbances. Our calculations of the overpressure and wind speed on the Earth''s surface show that the zone of destruction of the weakest structures can be as large as 700-1000 km in diameter; a decrease in the flight path angle to the surface leads to a marked increase in the area affected by the shock wave. The ionospheric disturbances are global in nature and continue for hours: at distances of several thousand kilometers at altitudes of more than 100 km, air density disturbances are tens of percent and the vertical and horizontal velocity components reach hundreds of meters per second. The impact of radiation on objects on the Earth''s surface is estimated by solving the equation of radiative transfer along rays passing through a luminous area. In clear weather, the size of the zone where thermal heating may ignite wood can be as large as 200 km, and the zone of individual fire outbreaks associated with the ignition of flammable materials can be twice as large. In the 100-km central area, which is characterized by very strong thermal damage, there is ignition of structures, roofs, clothes, etc. The human hazardous area increases with the decrease in the trajectory angle, and people may experience thermal effects at distances of up to 250-400 km from the crater.",49,1,2017,10.1134/S003809461701004X,,http://doi.org/10.1134/S003809461701004X,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Shuvalov, V.V., Svettsov, V.V., Artem'eva, N.A., Trubetskaya, I.A., Popova, O.P. and Glazachev, D.O., 2017.

In such a mission, the spinning motion of an asteroid can prevent a precise and effective deflection maneuver. To circumvent this problem, this study investigates a novel de-spin method using a solar sail spacecraft that is attached to the surface of an asteroid. In this approach, the solar radiation pressure torque induced by reflectivity control devices on the sail membrane is exploited to cancel out the spin rate of an asteroid without requiring fuel. In addition, once attitude control is achieved after the de-spin, the trajectory of the asteroid can be deflected by leveraging the solar radiation pressure force acting on the sail attached to the asteroid. This paper constructs general theories on the proposed asteroid de-spin and deflection methods and provides evidence that this novel strategy would be a feasible option for mitigating small and slow-spinning asteroids.",36,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.047,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.047,Engineering,"Kikuchi, S. and Kawaguchi, J.I., 2019.

Epistemic uncertainties can be reduced by replenishing incomplete information with a better means of observation, whereas stochastic uncertainties are inherent and irreducible owing to their randomness. Our understanding of asteroid deflection is largely limited by lack of in-situ data or full-scale experiments. Reducing these epistemic uncertainties in (1) the physical properties of asteroids or (2) the consequences of human interference will drastically benefit our mitigation efforts against their hazards. Much of previous literature concentrated on single-stage missions or simple asteroid models with fixed physical attributes, making it inadequate to handle epistemic or stochastic uncertainties. To fill this gap, this paper tries to incorporate different kinds of uncertainties within a campaign design framework. In a multi-stage campaign, a precursor is deployed first to reduce epistemic uncertainties. Because stochastic uncertainties cannot be reduced by nature, the campaign should be optimized to maximize its robustness against the worst random situations. Finally, whether or not a two-stage campaign is better than a single-stage mission can be visualized as a decision map for decision-makers.

The dragging of huge spinning bodies in space by external engine seems difficult or impossible. Our solution is based on the landing of multi screw-rockets, powered by mini-nuclear engines, on the body, that dig a small fraction of the soil surface to use as an exhaust propeller, ejecting it vertically in phase among themselves. Such a mass ejection increases the momentum exchange, their number redundancy guarantees the stability of the system. The slow landing (below similar or equal to 40 cm s(-1)) of each engine-unity at those very low gravity field, may be achieved by safe rolling and bouncing along the surface. The engine array tuned activity, overcomes the asteroid angular velocity. Coherent turning of the jet heads increases the deflection efficiency. A procession along its surface may compensate at best the asteroid spin. A small skin-mass (about 2 x 10(4) tons) may be ejected by mini-nuclear engines.

It is shown that on average the spacecraft can exert a significantly larger force on the asteroid than e.g. a stationary gravity tractor, thereby reducing the time needed to effect the desired deflection of the asteroid. Furthermore, the current method does not require canted thrusters on the spacecraft (unlike a stationary gravity tractor) markedly reducing the amount of fuel needed for a given deflection to be realized. The method also allows for the simultaneous use of several spacecraft, further strengthening the overall tugging effect on the asteroid, and distributing the thrust requirement among the spacecraft.",33,7,2017,10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.03.004,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.03.004,Engineering,"Ketema, Y., 2017.

In such a mission, the spinning motion of an asteroid can prevent a precise and effective deflection maneuver. To circumvent this problem, this study investigates a novel de-spin method using a solar sail spacecraft that is attached to the surface of an asteroid. In this approach, the solar radiation pressure torque induced by reflectivity control devices on the sail membrane is exploited to cancel out the spin rate of an asteroid without requiring fuel. In addition, once attitude control is achieved after the de-spin, the trajectory of the asteroid can be deflected by leveraging the solar radiation pressure force acting on the sail attached to the asteroid. This paper constructs general theories on the proposed asteroid de-spin and deflection methods and provides evidence that this novel strategy would be a feasible option for mitigating small and slow-spinning asteroids.",36,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.047,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.047,Engineering,"Kikuchi, S. and Kawaguchi, J.I., 2019.

Among proposed flexible path destinations are near-Earth objects, those asteroids and comets having perihelions of less than 1.3 astronomical units and periods of less than 200 years. Heliocentric-orbit element criteria have been developed with the objective of rapidly identifying the near-Earth object subset potentially accessible for human exploration capabilities. When these criteria were applied to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory''''s small-body database in June 2009, the accessible subset was found to contain 36 near-Earth objects. Opportunities to visit these destinations have been obtained and assessed over the interval from 2020 through 2050. With the number of cataloged near-Earth objects expected to grow by more than an order of magnitude in the next 20 years, the number and frequency of human near-Earth object exploration opportunities will likewise increase.",8,11,2010,10.2514/1.48681,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.48681,Engineering,"Adamo, D.R., Giorgini, J.D., Abell, P.A. and Landis, R.R., 2010.

However, unique amongst such global threats we have the capability of averting such disasters. Diversion approaches by either kinetic impactor or nuclear energy deposition are the two most practical technologies for mitigating hazardous near Earth asteroids. One of the greatest challenges in understanding our options is the uncertain response of asteroids to such impulsive techniques, due both to our lack of knowledge of the composition and structure of these objects as well as their highly varied nature. Predicting whether we will simply divert or break up a given object is a crucial: the weak self-gravity and inferred weak structure of typical asteroids present the strong possibility the body will fragment for modest impulses. Predictive modeling of failure and fragmentation is one important tool for such studies. In this paper we apply advances in modeling failure and fracture using Adaptive Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ASPH) to understand mega-cratering on asteroids as a validation exercise, and show examples of diverting the near Earth asteroid Bennu using both a kinetic impactor and ablative blow-off due to nuclear energy deposition.

The effect of attachment of a tether and ballast mass to the asteroid and then cutting the tether at an appropriate time is investigated in this paper.

The AIM spacecraft will characterize the asteroid target and monitor results of the impact in situ at Didymos. The DART mission is a full-scale kinetic impact to deflect a 150 m diameter asteroid, with known impactor conditions and with target physical properties characterized by the AIM mission. Predictions for the momentum transfer efficiency of kinetic impacts are given for several possible target types of different porosities, using Housen and Holsapple (2011) crater scaling model for impact ejecta mass and velocity distributions. Results are compared to numerical simulation results using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code of Jutzi and Michel (2014) with good agreement. The model also predicts that the ejecta from the DART impact may make Didymos into an active asteroid, forming an ejecta coma that may be observable from Earth-based telescopes. The measurements from AIDA of the momentum transfer from the DART impact, the crater size and morphology, and the evolution of an ejecta coma will substantially advance understanding of impact processes on asteroids.

With the help of local least-squares solutions in the phase space of the orbital elements, we map the volume of variation as a function of one or more of the elements. We sample the resulting volume using a Monte Carlo technique and, with proper weights for the sample orbital elements, characterize the six-dimensional orbital-element probability density function. The volume-of-variation (VOV) technique complements the statistical ranging technique for asteroids with exiguous observational data (short time intervals and/or small numbers of observations) and the least-squares technique for extensive observational data. We show that, asymptotically, results using the new technique agree closely with those from ranging and least squares. We apply the technique to the near-Earth object 2004 HA(39), the main-belt object 2004 QR and the transneptunian object 2002 CX224 recently observed at the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, illustrating the potential of the technique in ephemeris prediction. The VOV technique helps us assess the phase transition in orbital-element probability densities, that is, the non-linear collapse of wide orbital-element distributions to narrow localized ones. For the three objects above, the transition takes place for observational time intervals of the order of 10 h, 5 d and 10 months, respectively, emphasizing the significance of the orbital-arc fraction covered by the observations.",27,5,2006,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10168.x,,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10168.x,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Muinonen, K., Virtanen, J., Granvik, M. and Laakso, T., 2006.

In March of 2015, NASA selected the Robotic Boulder Capture Option(1) as the baseline for the ARRM. This option will capture a multi-ton boulder, (typically 2-4 meters in size) from the surface of a large (greater than similar to 100 m diameter) Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) and return it to cis-lunar space for subsequent human exploration during the ARCM. Further human and robotic missions to the asteroidal material would also be facilitated by its return to cis lunar space. In addition, prior to departing the asteroid, the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) will perform a demonstration of the Enhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT) planetary defense technique.(2) This paper will discuss the proximity operations which have been broken into three phases: Approach and Characterization, Boulder Capture, and Planetary Defense Demonstration.

The feasibility hinges on finding an overlap between the smallest NEAs that can be reasonably discovered and characterized and the largest NEAs that can be captured and transported in a reasonable flight time. This overlap appears to be centered on NEAs with a nominal diameter of roughly 7 m corresponding to masses in the range of 250,000 kg to 1,000,000 kg. Trajectory analysis based on asteroid 2008HU4 suggests that such an asteroid could be returned to a high-Earth orbit using a single Atlas V-class launch vehicle and a 40-kW solar electric propulsion system by 2026. The return of such an object could serve as a testbed for human operations in the vicinity of an asteroid. It would provide a wealth of scientific and engineering information and would enable detailed evaluation of its resource potential, determination of its internal structure and other aspects important for planetary defense activities.",27,,2012,,,,Engineering,"Brophy, J.R., Friedman, L. and Culick, F., 2012, March.

It reminded the world that impacts from near-Earth objects (NEOs), while rare, have the potential to cause great damage to cities and populations. Point estimates of the risk (such as mean numbers of casualties) have been proposed, but because of the low-probability, high-consequence nature of asteroid impacts, these averages provide limited actionable information. While more work is needed to further refine its input distributions (e.g., NEO diameters), the probabilistic model presented in this article allows a more complete evaluation of the risk of NEO impacts because the results are distributions that cover the range of potential casualties. This model is based on a modularized simulation that uses probabilistic inputs to estimate probabilistic risk metrics, including those of rare asteroid impacts. Illustrative results of this analysis are presented for a period of 100 years. As part of this demonstration, we assess the effectiveness of civil defense measures in mitigating the risk of human casualties. We find that they are likely to be beneficial but not a panacea. We also compute the probabilitybut not the consequencesof an impact with global effects (cataclysm). We conclude that there is a continued need for NEO observation, and for analyses of the feasibility and risk-reduction effectiveness of space missions designed to deflect or destroy asteroids that threaten the Earth.",36,2,2016,10.1111/risa.12453,,http://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12453,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences","Reinhardt, JC, Chen, X, Liu, WH, Manchev, P, and Pate-Cornell, ME, (2016).

During the deflection, the proximity motion of the spacecraft is coupled with the orbital and rotational motion of the asteroid. The combination of the deflection acceleration, solar radiation pressure, gravity field and plume impingement will force the spacecraft to drift away from the asteroid. In turn, a variation of the motion of the spacecraft produces a change in the modulus and direction of the deflection action which modifies the rotational and orbital motion of the asteroid. An on-board state estimation and control algorithm is then presented that simultaneously provides an optimal proximity control and a control of the rotational motion of the asteroid. It will be shown that the simultaneous control of the rotational and proximity motions of asteroid and spacecraft has a significant impact on the required deflection time. (C) 2015 COSPAR.

Consequently, several mission studies have already been carried out. This paper attempts to gain new insights into the target selection process by analyzing the orbital evolution of a large set of notional accessible asteroids that cover all types of Near Earth Object families. The evolution of their unperturbed orbits and their anthropogenically modified trajectories was compared, and a measure of the resilience of a given orbit to anthropogenic manipulation was taken (i.e., orbital innocuity). The results show that pruning criteria such as considering only Amor objects (i.e., non-Earth-crossers) reduce unnecessarily the population of potential suitable targets and that within large regions of Earth-crossing orbital space asteroids can be found that are both accessible and safe to manipulate from the standpoint of the Earth impact risk.",33,6,2015,10.1007/s40295-015-0046-0,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s40295-015-0046-0,Engineering,"Sanchez, JP, (2015).

It reminded the world that impacts from near-Earth objects (NEOs), while rare, have the potential to cause great damage to cities and populations. Point estimates of the risk (such as mean numbers of casualties) have been proposed, but because of the low-probability, high-consequence nature ofí‚Â asteroidí‚Â impacts, these averages provide limited actionable information. While more work is needed to further refine its input distributions (e.g.,í‚Â NEOí‚Â diameters), the probabilistic model presented in this article allows a more complete evaluation of the risk ofí‚Â NEOí‚Â impacts because the results are distributions that cover the range of potential casualties. This model is based on a modularized simulation that uses probabilistic inputs to estimate probabilistic risk metrics, including those of rareí‚Â asteroidí‚Â impacts. Illustrative results of this analysis are presented for a period of 100 years. As part of this demonstration, we assess the effectiveness of civil defense measures in mitigating the risk of human casualties. We find that they are likely to be beneficial but not a panacea. We also compute the probabilitybut not the consequencesof an impact with global effects (cataclysm). We conclude that there is a continued need forí‚Â NEOí‚Â observation, and for analyses of the feasibility and risk-reduction effectiveness of space missions designed to deflect or destroy asteroids that threaten the Earth.",,2,2016,,,http://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12453,,"Reinhardt, J.C., Chen, X., Liu, W., Manchev, P. and Paté-Cornell, M.E., 2016.

The burgeoning international Spaceguard program - which has an aim of discovering and determining the orbits of all possible Earth-impactors so that calamitous collisions can be avoided - will make this problem more acute, as the discovery rate increases. When NEOs reach visual magnitudes brighter than 21, they may be observed with suitable CCD-equipped telescopes with apertures of one metre or less; in fact, even 0.25-m aperture instruments are now being employed to great effect in this regard. This means that in the present situation, countries or individuals having access to quite modest-sized and modest-priced equipment can make a real, valuable contribution to this international effort. When Spaceguard begins in earnest it will be vital that astronomers spread around the world, using small telescopes, take over the tracking of NEOs discovered by the large, expensive, search instruments. The Spaceguard project therefore represents an excellent opportunity for international collaboration, with scientists in developing nations being valuable contributors in a space program with real significance for all humankind.*",13,,1996,10.1007/BF00056405,,http://doi.org/10.1007/BF00056405,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geology,"Steel, DI, and Marsden, BG, (1996).

Over the last two decades, the interest in asteroid missions for scientific exploration and near-Earth object hazard mitigation is increasing. In this paper, the problem of attitude stability is generalized to a rigid spacecraft on a stationary orbit around a uniformly-rotating asteroid. This generalized problem is studied via the linearized equations of motion, in which the harmonic coefficients C-20 and C-22 of the gravity field of the asteroid are considered. The necessary conditions of stability of this conservative system are investigated in detail with respect to three important parameters of the asteroid, which include the harmonic coefficients C-20 and C-22, as well as the ratio of the mean radius to the radius of the stationary orbit. We find that, due to the significantly non-spherical shape and the rapid rotation of the asteroid, the attitude stability domain is modified significantly in comparison with the classical stability domain predicted by the Beletskii-DeBra-Delp method on a circular orbit in a central gravity field. Especially, when the spacecraft is located on the intermediate-moment principal axis of the asteroid, the stability domain can be totally different from the classical stability domain. Our results are useful for the design of attitude control system in the future asteroid missions.",40,4,2013,10.1007/s10569-012-9463-6,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s10569-012-9463-6,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Mathematics,"Wang, Y, and Xu, SJ, (2013).

Our algorithm, based on the outline shape of elongated sources employs a step of image subtraction in order to reduce the confusion caused by dense distribution of faint stars. It takes less than a second to find and characterize streaks present in normal astronomical images of 2K format. Comparison with visual inspection proves the efficiency and completeness of our automated detection algorithm. When applied to about 7,000 time-series images from YSTAR telescope, nearly 700 incidents of streaks are detected. Fast moving objects are identified by the presence of matching streaks in adjoining frames. Nearly all of confirmed fast moving objects turn out to be artificial satellites or space debris.

Mission operation scenarios were designed for NASA''''s Deep Space Habitat (DSH), an analog spacecraft habitat, covering a range of activities including nominal objectives, DSH system failures, and crew medical emergencies. The scenarios were simulated at time delay values representative of Lunar (1.2-5 sec), Near Earth Object (NEO) (50 sec) and Mars (300 sec) missions. Each combination of operational scenario and time delay was tested in a Baseline configuration, designed to reflect present-day operations of the International Space Station, and a Mitigation configuration in which a variety of software tools, information displays, and crew-ground communications protocols were employed to assist both crews and Flight Control Team (FCT) members with the long-delay conditions. Preliminary findings indicate: 1) Workload of both crewmembers and FCT members generally increased along with increasing time delay. 2) Advanced procedure execution viewers, caution and warning tools, and communications protocols such as text messaging decreased the workload of both flight controllers and crew, and decreased the difficulty of coordinating activities. 3) Whereas crew workload ratings increased between 50 sec and 300 sec of time delay in the Baseline configuration, workload ratings decreased (or remained flat) in the Mitigation configuration.",18,,2013,,,,Engineering,"Frank, J, Spirkovska, L, McCann, R, Wang, L, Pohlkamp, K, and Morin, L, (2013).

The DART spacecraft will impact into Didymos-B, the moon of the binary system 65803 Didymos, and the resulting period change will be measured from Earth. Impact simulations will be used to predict the crater size and momentum enhancement expected from the DART impact. Because the specific material properties (strength, porosity, internal structure) of the Didymos-B target are unknown, a wide variety of numerical simulations must be performed to better understand possible impact outcomes. This simulation campaign will involve a large parameter space being simulated using multiple different shock physics hydrocodes. In order to understand better the behaviors and properties of numerical simulation codes applicable to the DART impact, a benchmarking and validation program using different numerical codes to solve a set of standard problems was designed and implemented. The problems were designed to test the effects of material strength, porosity, damage models, and target geometry on the ejecta following an impact and thus the momentum transfer efficiency. Several important results were identified from comparing simulations across codes, including the effects of model resolution and porosity and strength model choice: 1) momentum transfer predictions almost uniformly exhibit a larger variation than predictions of crater size; 2) the choice of strength model, and the values used for material strength, are significantly more important in the prediction of crater size and momentum enhancement than variation between codes; 3) predictions for crater size and momentum enhancement tend to be similar (within 15-20%) when similar strength models are used in different codes. These results will be used to better design a modeling plan for the DART mission as well as to better understand the potential results that may be expected due to unknown target properties. The DART impact simulation team will determine a specific desired material parameter set appropriate for the Didymos system that will be standardized (to the extent possible) across the different codes when making predictions for the DART mission. Some variation in predictions will still be expected, but that variation can be bracketed by the results shown in this study.",59,3,2020,10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113446,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113446,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Stickle, AM, Syal, MB, Cheng, AF, Collins, GS, Davison, TM, Gisler, G, Guldemeister, N, Heberling, T, Luther, R, Michel, P, Miller, P, Owen, JM, Rainey, ESG, Rivkin, AS, Rosch, T and Wunnemann, K, (2020).

Several schemes are constructed to quantify the navigation performance affected by different combinations of measurements, which are obtained from each spacecraft within a 2-spacecraft formation. Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is then proposed to simultaneously estimate the position and velocity of each spacecraft with respect to the asteroid.

However, they can be challenging platforms for detecting and imaging low brightness targets. Difficulties include constrained bandwidth, which limits the volume of data that can be downlinked; attitude instability, which limits exposure time; small instrument apertures, which reduce sensitivity; and cosmic ray contamination, which creates illusory sources. Mission designers can address all these problems simultaneously by shifting image analysis across the communications gap. Spacecraft can use onboard data analysis to detect sources directly, or downlink parsimonious summary products for detection on the ground. One promising approach is to acquire stacks of short consecutive exposures, and then coregister and coadd them onboard. This work analyzes a coaddition algorithm that is designed to be robust against small spacecraft challenges. We evaluate factors affecting performance, such as attitude control and camera noise systematics, in regimes typical of small spacecraft missions. We motivate the algorithm design by considering its application to NEAScout, a mission representing a new generation of small (sub-50kg) exploration spacecraft having very small instrument apertures and data rates below 1kbytes(-1).

Different assumptions regarding the physics are explored to demonstrate how these impact the Geant4 simulation results. In general, all of the Geant4 results overpredict the data; however, certain physics lists perform better than others.

The impact of the DART spacecraft onto the secondary of the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos at a speed of 5 to 7 km/s is expected to alter the mutual orbit by an observable amount. The velocity transferred to the secondary depends largely on the momentum enhancement factor, typically referred to as beta. We use two hydrocodes developed at Los Alamos, RAGE and PAGOSA, to calculate an approximate value for beta in laboratory-scale benchmark experiments.

These important targets for future missions may have recently been Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), which are thought to be chemically and physically primitive remnants of the early solar system. While the Kuiper Belt spans distances of 30-50 AU, making direct observations difficult, Centaurs'''' proximity to the Earth and Sun make them more accessible targets for robotic missions. Thus, we outline a mission concept designed to reconnoiter 10199 Chariklo, the largest Centaur and smallest ringed body yet discovered. Named for a legendary Centaur tamer, the conceptual Camilla mission is designed to fit under the cost cap of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) New Frontiers program, leveraging a conservative payload to support a foundational scientific investigation to these primitive bodies. Specifically, the single flyby encounter utilizes a combined high-resolution camera/VIS-IR mapping spectrometer, a sub-mm point spectrometer, and a UV mapping spectrometer. In addition, the mission concept utilizes a kinetic impactor, which would provide the first opportunity to sample the composition of potentially primitive subsurface material beyond Saturn, thus providing key insights into solar system origins.

Although many past space missions have been designed mainly from a mission-level perspective, a campaign-level perspective will be important for future space exploration. In order to find the optimal campaign-level space transportation architecture, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation with a generalized multi-commodity flow and a time-expanded network is developed. Particularly, a new heuristics-based method, a partially static time-expanded network, is developed to provide a solution quickly. The developed method is applied to a case study containing human exploration of a near-Earth object (NEO) and Mars, related to the concept of the Flexible Path. The numerical results show that using the specific combinations of propulsion technologies, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and other space infrastructure elements can reduce the initial mass in low-Earth orbit (IMLEO) significantly. In addition, the case study results also show that we can achieve large IMLEO reduction by designing NEO and Mars missions together as a campaign compared with designing them separately owing to their common space infrastructure pre-deployment. This research will be an important step toward efficient and flexible campaign-level space mission planning. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although such events have an impact interval on the order of 100M years, a method of rapid response to such a threat is crucial, since warning time is short. Objects in the 0.1 to 1 km size range may not be detected before approaching within 1 to 10 astronomical units (AU) of Earth and, since their approach velocity may be 30-60 km/s, that situation leaves 100 - 300 days to respond. Although the most frequently suggested response to such a threat is a standoff nuclear detonation, physically delivered to the NEO, this paper finds significant advantages in retargeting, probability of success and even precise target location are possible with a high power laser alternative. Assuming a momentum coupling coefficient C(m) = 3.5 dyn-s/J and detection at 6.3AU, a 770kW repetitive pulse 355nm laser (f = 1.7 ppm with 27MJ, lops pulses) will deflect a 200-m-diameter icy NEO sufficiently to avoid collision.

Global optimization methods are proposed for the preliminary design. Local direct and indirect methods are applied to optimize the two-impulse transfers. Indirect methods are implemented to optimize the low-thrust trajectory and estimate the largest retrievable mass. To overcome the difficulty that arises from bang-bang control, a homotopic approach is applied to find an approximate solution. By detecting the switching moments of the bang-bang control the efficiency and accuracy of numerical integration are guaranteed. By using the homotopic approach as the initial guess the shooting function is easy to solve. The relationship between the maximum thrust and the retrieval mass is investigated.

Several variants of planetary migration with this kind of system architecture have been proposed. Here, we focus on a highly successful case, which assumes that there were once five planets in the outer Solar System in a stable configuration: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and a Neptune-like body. Beyond these planets existed a primordial disk containing thousands of Pluto-sized bodies, similar to 50 million D > 100 km bodies, and a multitude of smaller bodies. This system eventually went through a dynamical instability that scattered the planetesimals and allowed the planets to encounter one another. The extra Neptune-like body was ejected via a Jupiter encounter, but not before it helped to populate stable niches with disk planetesimals across the Solar System. Here, we investigate how interactions between the fifth giant planet, Jupiter, and disk planetesimals helped to capture disk planetesimals into both the asteroid belt and first-order mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. Using numerical simulations, we find that our model produces the right proportion of P-and D-type asteroids in the inner, central, and outer main belt, while also populating the Hilda and Thule regions in Jupiter''s 3/2 and 4/3 resonances. Moreover, the largest observed P/D types in each sub-population are an excellent fit to our captured population results (within uncertainties). The model produces a factor of similar to 10 overabundance of diameter D > 10 km P/D types in the main belt, but this mismatch can likely be explained by various removal mechanisms (e.g., collision evolution over 4 Gyr, dynamical losses via Yarkovsky thermal forces over 4 Gyr, thermal destruction of the planetesimals en route to the inner solar system). Overall, our instability model provides a more satisfying match to constraints than that of Levison et al., and it provides us with strong supporting evidence that the five giant planet instability model is reasonable. Our results lead us to predict that D-type asteroids found in the near-Earth object population on low delta-V orbits with Earth are the surviving relics from the same source population that now make up the Kuiper Belt, the irregular satellites, and the Jupiter Trojans. The singular Tagish Lake meteorite, a primitive sample unlike other carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, is likely a fragment from a D-type asteroid implanted into the inner main belt. This would effectively make it the first known hand sample with the same composition as Kuiper Belt objects.",96,8,2016,10.3847/0004-6256/152/2/39,,http://doi.org/10.3847/0004-6256/152/2/39,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Vokrouhlicky, D, Bottke, W, and Nesvorny, D, (2016).

These include earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, asteroid strikes, and so on. Some of these disasters occur slowly enough that some advance warning is possible for affected areas. In this case, the response is to evacuate the affected area and deal with the damage later. The Katrina and Rita hurricane evacuations on the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005 demonstrated the chaos that can result from such a response. In contrast with other natural disasters, it is likely that an asteroid or comet nucleus on a collision course with Earth will be detected with enough warning time to possibly deflect it away. Thanks to Near-Earth Object (NEO) surveys, people are working towards a goal of cataloging at least 90% of all near-Earth objects with diameters larger than similar to 140 meters in the next fifteen years. The important question then, is how to mitigate the threat from an asteroid or comet nucleus found to be on a collision course with Earth.

Lacking proper astrometric observations, the pre-impact orbit of this object has been determined using videos, satellite images, and pure geometry. Unfortunately, more than two years after the event, the published estimates vary so much that there is no clear orbital solution that could be used to investigate the origin of the impactor and the existence of dynamically, or perhaps even genetically, related asteroids. Here, we revisit this topic using a full N-body approach. A robust statistical test is applied to published solutions to discard those unable to produce a virtual impact at the observed time (03: 20: 20.8 +/- 0.1 s UTC). The same N-body methodology and the latest ephemerides are used to compute a new orbital solution: a = 1.6247 AU, e = 0.5318, i = 3 degrees.9750, Omega = 326 degrees.4607, and omega = 109 degrees.7012. This new solution-which has an impact probability >0.99999 and uncertainties in time and space of 0.2 s and 6 km, respectively-is utilized to explore the past orbital evolution of the impactor as well as the presence of near-Earth objects moving in similar paths. A dynamical link between asteroid 2011 EO40 and the Chelyabinsk impactor is confirmed. Alternative orbital solutions are extensively explored.",67,10,2015,10.1088/0004-637X/812/1/26,,http://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/812/1/26,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Marcos, CD, Marcos, RD, and Aarseth, SJ, (2015).

With independent observations of the visible debris plume from a more oblique view, the angles and velocities of the ejecta from this unique cratering experiment are better constrained. Here we report the first visible observations of the LCROSS ejecta plume from Earth, thereby ascertaining the morphology of the plume to contain a minimum of two separate components, placing limits on ejecta velocities at multiple angles, and permitting an independent estimate of the illuminated ejecta mass.

In order to extrapolate the sample of objects detected by WISE to the greater population, we determined the survey biases for asteroids detected by the project''s automated moving object processing system (known as NEOWISE) as a function of diameter, visible albedo, and orbital elements. Using this technique, we are able to place constraints on the number of potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 100 m and find that there are similar to 4700 +/- 1450 such objects. As expected, the Atens, Apollos, and Amors are revealed by WISE to have somewhat different albedo distributions, with the Atens being brighter than the Amors. The cumulative size distributions of the various near-Earth object (NEO) subgroups vary slightly between 100 m and 1 km.

The technology to perform such a deflection has been demonstrated by the Deep Impact (DI) mission, which successfully collided with comet Tempel 1 in July 2005 using an onboard autonomous navigation system, called AutoNav, for the terminal phase of the mission. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of AutoNav to impact a wider range of scenarios that a deflection mission could encounter, varying parameters such as the approach velocity, phase angle, size of the asteroid, and the attitude determination accuracy. In particular, we evaluated the capability of AutoNav to impact 100-300 m size asteroids at speeds between 7.5 and 20 km/s at various phase angles. Using realistic Monte Carlo simulations, we tabulated the probability of success of the deflection as a function of these parameters and find the highest sensitivity to be due to the spacecraft attitude determination error. In addition, we also specifically analyzed the impact probability for a proposed mission (called ISIS) which would send an impactor to the asteroid 1999RQ36. We conclude with some recommendations for future work. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Assuming that a tugboat-spacecraft is in a rendez-vous condition with the candidate asteroid, the aim is to take the joint spacecraft-asteroid system to a selected periodic orbit of the Sun-Earth restricted three-body system: the orbit can be either a libration point periodic orbit (LPO) or a distant prograde periodic orbit (DPO) around the Earth. In detail, low-thrust propulsion is used to bring the joint spacecraft-asteroid system from the initial condition to a point belonging to the stable manifold associated to the final periodic orbit: from here onward, thanks to the intrinsic dynamics of the physical model adopted, the flight is purely ballistic. Dedicated guided and capture sets are introduced to exploit the combined use of low-thrust propulsion with stable manifolds trajectories, aiming at defining feasible first guess solutions. Then, an optimal control problem is formulated to refine and improve them. This approach enables a new class of missions, whose solutions are not obtainable neither through the patched-conics method nor through the classic invariant manifolds technique.",77,11,2014,10.1007/s10569-014-9589-9,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s10569-014-9589-9,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Mathematics,"Mingotti, G, Sanchez, JP, and McInnes, CR, (2014).

The Bulirsh-Stoer and a symplectic orbit integrator gave similar results for orbital evolution, but may give different collision probabilities with the Sun. A small fraction of former JCOs reached orbits with aphelia inside Jupiter''''s orbit and some reached Apollo orbits with semi-major axes less than 2 AU, Aten orbits and inner-Earth orbits (with aphelia less than 0.983 AU) and remained there for millions of years. Though less than 0.1% of the total, these objects were responsible for most of the collision probability of former JCOs with Earth and Venus.

Although the majority of space rocks smaller than 25 meters disintegrate during their decent through Earth''''s atmosphere, larger objects have the potential to penetrate this protective layer and cause extensive damage. A mile-wide asteroid travelling at 30,000 miles per hour has an impact energy equivalent to a large megaton (Mt) bomb and would likely wipe out most of the life on Earth. Residents near Chelyabinsk, Russia experienced the detrimental effects of a collision with a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) on February 15, 2013 when an similar to 20 m object penetrated the atmosphere above the city. The effective yield from the object''''s impact was equivalent to a similar to 1/2 Mt TNT explosion, comparable to that of a large strategic warhead. Previously, in 1908, Russia had experienced an impact thirty times larger, the Tunguska event, which had the estimated yield equivalent to an similar to 15 Mt TNT explosion. Thankfully, both of these events occurred in relatively remote areas of the globe; however, it would have only taken a minuscule fluctuation in trajectory to redirect these objects to a heavily populated area, resulting in extensive damages and death. In the face of such danger, a planetary defense system is a necessity. The proposed DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation) is a phased array laser system that is capable of, but not limited, oblation, deflection, and de-spinning both asteroids and comets. This paper is a continuation of previous papers that detail the design and applications of such a system, including remote composition analysis, asteroid mining, and interstellar travel. The thrust induced by various DE-STAR configurations on numerous comets is simulated through finite element analysis (FEA), adhering and adjusting to their unique physical properties, such as their rotation rates, emissivity, thermal conductivity, etc.",10,,2016,10.1117/12.2238475,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2238475,Optics,"Madajian, J, Griswold, J, Gandra, A, Hughes, GB, Zhang, QC, Rupert, N, and Lubin, P, (2016).

Three design blocks are considered, which differ in the power available to the deflection technology and the mass at low-Earth orbit. We plot the required warning time (up to 30 years between discovery of the hazard and potential collision with Earth) vs. asteroid diameter for each of four technologies (gravity tractor without enhancement is considered only as a trim/verification candidate) under each design block, and illustrate sensitivities of results to important parameters. Under assumptions detailed in the study, we find the following: For asteroids up to about 200-300 meters in diameter (depending on design block), KI achieves the desired deflection with the least amount of warning time required, and its range of applicability increases to about 500-600 meters with a series of (e.g., three) missions. Terminal guidance capability required to ensure that a sufficiently massive impactor can reliably be made to collide with a relatively small asteroid at high speed can be accommodated via judicious camera selection and guidance-and-control parameter adjustment (along with sufficient rocket performance), and does not require further technology development. But KI''''s deflection capability lacks the precision that may be needed to avoid pushing an asteroid into a gravitational ''keyhole''' that would cause the asteroid to intercept Earth at another time. It has long been recognized that KI would require implementation of a second spacecraft to rendezvous with the threat object""",14,,2015,,,,Engineering,"Weisbin, C., Lincoln, W., Wilcox, B., Brophy, J., Chodas, P. and Muirhead, B., 2015, March.

The development of the analysis considers the minimum energy required by each concept and presents qualitative comparisons of relative complexity and technical risks. The Mass Driver alters the asteroid trajectory by electromagnetically accelerating fragments from its surface, while the Disperser provides escape velocity to the entire mass of the asteroid. The brief study concludes that the Disperser is preferred over the Mass Driver regarding the energy requirements, complexity and technical risk; while the Mass Driver is preferred over the Disperser regarding the mass of the mining machinery which must be transported to the threatening asteroid. A hybrid concept which adds angular rate to the asteroid is also defined and analyzed. The greatest risk to all the concepts resides in the uncertainty of the composition of the asteroid as it relates to the mining operations required by all the concepts and it is recommended that the overall planetary defense strategy consider the contribution of all the concepts discussed since we cannot tell in advance what type of asteroid will threaten Earth.",8,9,2005,,,,Engineering; Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geology,"Friedman, G, (2005).

We report measured spectral properties for more than 1000 NEOs, representing >5% of the currently discovered population. Thermal flux detected below 2.5 mu m allows us to make albedo estimates for nearly 50 objects, including two comets. Additional spectral data are reported for more than 350 Mars-crossing asteroids. Most of these measurements were achieved through a collaboration between researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Hawaii, with full cooperation of the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea. We call this project the MIT-Hawaii Near-Earth Object Spectroscopic Survey (MITHNEOS; myth-neos). While MITHNEOS has continuously released all spectral data for immediate use by the scientific community, our objectives for this paper are to: (1) detail the methods and limits of the survey data, (2) formally present a compilation of results including their taxonomic classification within a single internally consistent framework, (3) perform a preliminary analysis on the overall population characteristics with a concentration toward deducing key physical processes and identifying their source region for escaping the main belt. Augmenting our newly published measurements are the previously published results from the broad NEO community, including many results graciously shared by colleagues prior to formal publication. With this collective data set, we find the near-Earth population matches the diversity of the main-belt, with all main-belt taxonomic classes represented in our sample. Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as well as the subset of mission accessible asteroids (Delta V <= 7 km/s) both appear to be a representative mix of the overall NEO population, consistent with strong dynamical mixing for the population that interacts most closely with Earth. Mars crossers, however, are less diverse and appear to more closely match the inner belt population from where they have more recently diffused. The fractional distributions of major taxonomic classes (60% S, 20% C, 20% other) appear remarkably constant over two orders of magnitude in size (10 km to 100 m), which is eight orders of magnitude in mass, though we note unaccounted bias effects enter into our statistics below about 500 m. Given the range of surface ages, including possible refreshment by planetary encounters, we are able to identify a very specific space weathering vector tracing the transition from Q- to Sq- to S-types that follows the natural dispersion for asteroid spectra mapped into principal component space. We also are able to interpret a shock darkening vector that may account for some objects having featureless spectra. Space weathering effects for C-types are complex; these results are described separately by Lantz, Binzel, DeMeo. (2018, Icarus 302, 10-17). Independent correlation of dynamical models with taxonomic classes map the escape zones for NEOs to main-belt regions consistent with well established heliocentric compositional gradients. We push beyond taxonomy to interpret our visible plus near-infrared spectra in terms of the olivine and pyroxene mineralogy consistent with the H, L, and LL classes of ordinary chondrites meteorites. Correlating meteorite interpretations with dynamical escape region models shows a preference for LL chondrites to arrive from the v6 resonance and H chondrites to have a preferential signature from the mid-belt region (3:1 resonance). L chondrites show some preference toward the outer belt, but not at a significant level. We define a Space Weathering Parameter as a continuous variable and find evidence for step-wise changes in space weathering properties across different planet crossing zones in the inner solar system. Overall we hypothesize the relative roles of planetary encounters, YORP spin-up, and thermal cycling across the inner solar system.",126,5,2019,10.1016/j.icarus.2018.12.035,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.12.035,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Binzel, RP, Demeo, FE, Turtelboom, EV, Bus, SJ, Tokunaga, A, Burbine, TH, Lantz, C, Polishook, D, Carry, B, Morbidelli, A, Birlan, M, Vernazza, P, Burt, BJ, Moskovitz, N, Slivan, SM, Thomas, CA, Rivkin, AS, Hicks, MD, Dunn, T, Reddy, V, Sanchez, JA, Granvik, M, and  Kohout, T, (2019).

The program is aimed at answering the following fundamental questions ranging from how the solar system works, what the conditions for planet formation are and the emergence of life, to the formation of the Universe and its composition. Following a call for mission proposals early 2007 and after a review and an initial down selection, nine mission candidates, out of 50 proposals, were retained to go into the next round, the competitive assessment study within the European Space Agency together with industrial partners. The astrophysics and fundamental physics mission candidates comprise a dark energy mission (EUCLID), a medium to far infrared mission to discover the origins of galaxies, stars and planets (SPICA), an international X-ray observatory (IXO), a mission to observe planetary transients and oscillations of stars (PLATO) and a space interferometer consisting of a formation of spacecraft to detect gravitational waves (LISA). Apart from the astrophysics missions there are four solar system mission candidates: a fleet of spacecraft for investigating plasma coupling (Cross Scale), a near Earth object return mission (Marco Polo), a mission to explore the Sun (Solar Orbiter) and a mission to Europa and the Jupiter System (Laplace/EJSM). This paper (1,2), gives an overview of ESA''''s long-term science program Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 including the selection process and describes the candidate missions with emphasis on the payload concepts of future astrophysics missions.",0,,2010,,,,Engineering,"Heske, A, (2010).

Space technology is reaching a sufficient level of capability and maturity where the deflection of an Earth impactor may be possible within the next decades. The paper focuses on assessing the maximum deflection capability (minimum response time) that could be achieved with a rendezvous/landed spacecraft, using electric propulsion and nuclear/solar power technologies likely to be available in the near-term, within the constraints of a single heavy launch into low Earth orbit. Preliminary design concepts are presented for large, high-power nuclear and solar electric spacecraft, based on a trade-off analysis of power/ propulsion technology options and an optimisation of the complete mission design to the minimise the total response time for a representative impactor/deflection scenario. High specific impulse gridded-ion engines show significantly improved mission performance over Hall effect thrusters due to the high delta-V requirements for Earth spiral out, rendezvous, spin axis re-orientation and deflection. Amorphous silicon thin film solar arrays perform substantially better than conventional high cell efficiency alternatives. It was found that solar electric spacecraft could achieve lower total response times for the deflection than a nuclear electric spacecraft of the same initial mass, if the asteroid perihelion is much lower than the Earth. The comparison is expected to be much closer if the asteroid perihelion is near the Earth.

NEOs have collided with our planet in the past, sometimes to devastating effect, and continue to do so today. Collisions with NEOs large enough to do significant damage to the ground are fortunately infrequent, but such events can occur at any time and we therefore need to develop and validate the techniques and technologies necessary to prevent the Earth impact of an incoming NEO. In this paper we provide background on the hazard posed to Earth by NEOs and present the results of a recent study performed by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center''''s Mission Design Lab (MDL) in collaboration with Iowa State University''''s Asteroid Deflection Research Center (ADRC) to design a flight validation mission for a Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) as part of a Phase 2 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) research project. The HAIV is a two-body vehicle consisting of a leading kinetic impactor and trailing follower carrying a Nuclear Explosive Device (NED) payload. The HAIV detonates the NED inside the crater in the NEO''''s surface created by the lead kinetic impactor portion of the vehicle, effecting a powerful subsurface detonation to disrupt the NEO. For the flight validation mission, only a simple mass proxy for the NED is carried in the HAIV. Ongoing and future research topics are discussed following the presentation of the detailed flight validation mission design results produced in the MDL.

The existing penetrated subsurface nuclear explosion technology limits the intercept velocity to less than approximately 300 m/s. Consequently, an innovative concept of blending a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion has been developed for optimal penetration, fragmentation, and dispersion of the target NEO. A proposed hypervelocity asteroid intercept vehicle (HAIV) consists of a kinetic-impact leader spacecraft and a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives.

In order to reliably assess future impact threat mitigation operations such uncertainties have to be quantified and incorporated into the mission design. The implementation of deflection demonstration missions offers the great opportunity to test our current understanding of deflection relevant uncertainties and their consequences, e.g., regarding kinetic impacts on asteroid surfaces. In this contribution, we discuss the role of uncertainties in the NEOT omega IST asteroid deflection demonstration concept, a low-cost kinetic impactor design elaborated in the framework of the NEOShield project. The aim of NEOT omega IST is to change the spin state of a known and well characterized near-Earth object, in this case the asteroid (25143) Itokawa. Fast events such as the production of the impact crater and ejecta are studied via cube-sat chasers and a flyby vehicle. Long term changes, for instance, in the asteroid''''s spin and orbit, can be assessed using ground based observations. We find that such a mission can indeed provide valuable constraints on mitigation relevant parameters. Furthermore, the here proposed kinetic impact scenarios can be implemented within the next two decades without threatening Earth''''s safety.",16,,2016,10.1017/S1743921315008698,,http://doi.org/10.1017/S1743921315008698,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Eggl, S, Hestroffer, D, Cano, JL, Avila, JM, Drube, L, Harris, AW, Falke, A, Johann, U, Engel, K, Schwartz, SR, Michel, P, (2016).

We did not detect 2009 BD in 25 hr of integration at 4.5 mu m. Based on an upper-limit flux density determination from our data, we present a probabilistic derivation of the physical properties of this object. The analysis is based on the combination of a thermophysical model with an orbital model accounting for the non-gravitational forces acting upon the body. We find two physically possible solutions. The first solution shows 2009 BD as a 2.9 +/- 0.3 m diameter rocky body (rho = 2.9 +/- 0.5 g cm(-3)) with an extremely high albedo of 0.85(-0.10)(+0.20) that is covered with regolith-like material, causing it to exhibit a low thermal inertia (Gamma = 30(-10)(+20) SI units).

Inexpensive transportation to low Earth orbit is the first requirement for a great future on the High Frontier. Inexpensive means the cost associated with a mature transportation system. A mature system has a cost of three to five times the cost of the propellant. The first cheap, reliable and highly reusable rocket engines are just now appearing in vehicles. With an assured market and high flight rate, the heretofore glacial progress in reducing the cost of space transportation is likely to become rapid. This is the first critical enabling example of synergy between free market economics and scientific and technical progress in space. It will not be the last. New high power switches and ultracapacitors developed for the automotive market make possible cheap, robust and reliable mass driver engines. In space construction, using masses of nonterrestrial materials make the gravity tractor technique much more capable than previous schemes to maneuver asteroids. Ion propulsion will continue to improve and the first solar sails will be flown. Advanced robotics will allow remarkable improvements in productivity. The computing power available to robots began to follow the exponential Moore''s law less than decade ago. The fast commercial autonomous mobile robots appeared in late summer 2006. Humans, however, will be required for the foreseeable future in repair and supervisory roles, particularly in unstructured settings such as asteroid mines. The evolution from small tourist stations of the next decade to large space hotels will make economical the use of fully closed life-support systems. These could be considered the first space colonies. Derivatives of these commercial space hotels may form suitable Moon and asteroid mining habitats. Using nonterrestrial materials is a key to opening the space frontier. Dozens of rendezvous missions to Near Earth Objects will be needed to assay their resources and to plan rational NEO diversion. The development of NEO mining techniques serves two purposes, raw materials supply and planetary defense. We need economical trajectories to and from these bodies. These trajectories must not only be economical in terms of delta V or time, but in dollars; and in the time value of money, factors not generally considered by the OMB. Satellite solar power stations may be a $500 billion per year market worldwide and cheap nickel steel from asteroids may be an enabler of power satellite construction. One asteroid of the right size and composition in a suitable orbit could open this market. Platinum group metals may be an important export, either as a primary product or as a byproduct of nickel steel alloy production. Other products, derived from carbon, may also be important. The first economical product from an asteroid mine is likely to be water, for propellant or life-support and radiation shielding in space hotels.",13,,2007,,,,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics,"Valentine, LS, (2007).

What is presented in this paper is the capacity to use a solar sail like vehicle to change the orbit of a small body of the solar system by hovering over its sunlit surface. One of the forces that affect the orbit of small bodies is a tiny but permanent thrust of thermal origin, the intensity and direction of which are directly related to the nature of the soil, the characteristics of the rotation and the physical properties of the body. This effect is known as the Yarkovsky Effect. It concerns mainly hundred meter class asteroids. There are hundred thousands of small bodies of this type. About 10% of them are classified as Near Earth Object and one of them, APOPHIS, is of special interest. APOPHIS has been discovered in 2004. Its diameter is estimated to be 270 m. Its rotation period is around 30 h so the Yarkovsky Effect on its orbit should not be negligible. These parameters and possibly others should be refined in 2012 when this asteroid can be observed again. APOPHIS will make a very close (40,000 km) approach to the Earth in April 2029. Depending on the geometry of its swing-by, it can be placed on an impact orbit to the Earth and present a danger for the future decades. The areas that correspond to such trajectories are called Resonant Orbit Keyholes and are only a few hundred meter wide. From the observation in 2012, it will be possible to determine the magnitude of the Yarkovsky Effect on APOPHIS and to greatly improve the prevision of its 2029 swing-by. If the Yarkovsky Effect is found to be important, cancelling it will be sufficient to avoid any keyhole and prevent any future collision with the Earth. We call Yarkovsky Effect Suppression (YES) this deflection method. This effect can be cancelled by shadowing and cooling down the asteroid with a flotilla of solar shields. This new type of solar sails will have to counter the photonic pressure in order to maintain their hovering position. In this paper, we propose a preliminary mission design and the main system requirements, especially as regards station keeping. This mission is named SHADOW. Finally we discuss the pros and cons of this strategy and compare its effectiveness to already identified mitigation methods. (C) 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To mitigate this, the use of an orbital propellant depot has been extensively studied. In this paper, a thermal model of an orbital propellant depot is used to examine the effects of passive and active thermal management strategies. Results show that an all passive thermal management strategy results in significant boil-off for both hydrogen and oxygen. At current launch vehicle prices, these boil-offs equate to millions of dollars lost per month. Zero boil-off of propellant is achievable with the use of active cryocoolers; however, the cooling power required to produce zero-boil-off is an order of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art cryocoolers. This study shows a zero-boil-off cryocooler minimum power requirement of 80-100 W at 80 K for liquid oxygen, and 100-120 W at 20 K for liquid hydrogen for a representative Near-Earth Object mission. Research and development effort is required to improve the state-of-the-arts in-space cryogenic thermal management. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the latitude distribution of impactor sites and find that for both the Earth and Moon there is a small deficiency of time-averaged impact rates at the poles. The ratio between deliveries within 30 degrees of the pole to that of a 30 degrees band centered on the equator is small for Earth (<5%) (0.958 +/- 0.001) and somewhat greater for the Moon (similar to 10%) (0.903 +/- 0.005). The terrestrial arrival results are examined to determine the degree of AM/PM asymmetry to compare with the PM excess shown in meteorite fall times. We find that the average lunar impact velocity is 20 km/s, which has ramifications in converting observed crater densities to impactor size distributions. We determine that current crater production on the leading hemisphere of the Moon is 1.28 +/- 0.01 that of the trailing when considering the ratio of craters within 30 degrees of the apex to those within 30 degrees of the antapex and that there is virtually no nearside-farside asymmetry, in agreement with observations of rayed craters. As expected, the degree of leading-trailing asymmetry increases when the Moon''''s Orbital distance is decreased. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Detecting objects like the Chelyabinsk impactor that are orbiting near Earth is a difficult task, in part because such objects spend much of their own orbits in the direction of the Sun when viewed from Earth. Efforts aimed at protecting Earth from future impacts will rely heavily on continued discovery. Ground-based optical observatory networks and Earth-orbiting spacecraft with infrared sensors have dramatically increased the pace of discovery. Still, less than 5% of near-Earth objects (NEOs) >= 100 m/similar to 100 Mt TNT have been identified, and the proportion of known objects decreases rapidly for smaller sizes. Low emissivity of some objects also makes detection by passive sensors difficult. A proposed orbiting laser phased array directed energy system could be used for active illumination of NEOs, enhancing discovery particularly for smaller and lower emissivity objects. Laser fiber amplifiers emit very narrow-band energy, simplifying detection. Results of simulated illumination scenarios are presented based on an orbiting emitter array with specified characteristics. Simulations indicate that return signals from small and low emissivity objects is strong enough to detect. The possibility for both directed and full sky blind surveys is discussed, and the resulting diameter and mass limits for objects in different observational scenarios. The ability to determine both position and speed of detected objects is also discussed.",10,,2014,10.1117/12.2061355,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2061355,Optics; Physics,"Riley, J, Lubin, P, Hughes, GB, O'Neill, H, Meinhold, P, Suen, J, Bible, J, Johansson, IE, Griswold, J, Cook, B, (2014).

The big question in the extrapolation to larger scales is whether the damage process in the crater formation saturates at some scale - i.e., is there a size beyond which the momentum enhancement does scale, and thus the large scale large values are not realized. In this work we take the data from the NASA Ames gun in the 1960s by Denardo and Nysmith [1] and examine its clear lack of scaling in more detail. We determine the behavior of the ejecta mass. We show that the amount of ejecta mass is proportional to the impact velocity squared times the square root of the projectile diameter, a quantity which has the dimensions of fracture toughness. Thus, it is likely that the mass liberation process depends on fracture toughness, which contrasts with the fact that the crater size depends on target material strength. Thus, a small fracture toughness leads to large ejecta mass, and that in turn leads to large momentum enhancement. The appearance of the dimensions of fracture toughness implies that classical failure scaling is at work. Classical fracture mechanics is a damage process that likely will not saturate and that we then are able to extrapolate to large sizes. We discuss impactors that would be used to deflect asteroids or comet nuclei for planetary defense or for engineering and exploration purposes, and what expected momentum enhancements would be for impacts into asteroids or comet nuclei comprised of consolidated materials.

The results are consistent with previous estimates. There are similar to 1000 NEOs with diameter D > 1 km and the mean albedo to convert absolute magnitude into diameter is 0.147. We don''''t find any statistically significant evidence that the albedo distribution of NEOs depends on NEO size. Instead, we find evidence that the disruption of NEOs at small perihelion distances found in Granvik et al. (2016) occurs preferentially for dark NEOs. The interval between km-sized bodies striking the Earth should occur on average once every 750,000 years.

Here we report our study of how the debris streams arise from possible thermally driven disruptions in the near-Sun region. We calculate that a small body with a diameter greater than or similar to 0.5 km can produce a sufficient amount of material to allow the detection of the debris at the Earth as meteor showers, and that bodies at such sizes thermally disrupt every similar to 2 kyr. We also find that objects from the inner parts of the asteroid belt are more likely to become Sun-approachers than those from the outer parts. We simulate the formation and evolution of the debris streams produced from a set of synthetic disrupting asteroids drawn from Granvik et al.''''s near-Earth object population model, and find that they evolve 10-70 times faster than streams produced at ordinary solar distances. We compare the simulation results to a catalog of known meteor showers on Sun-approaching orbits. We show that there is a clear overabundance of Sun-approaching meteor showers, which is best explained by a combining effect of comet contamination and an extended disintegration phase that lasts up to a few thousand years. We suggest that a few asteroid-like Sun-approaching objects that brighten significantly at their perihelion passages could, in fact, be disrupting asteroids. An extended period of thermal disruption may also explain the widespread detection of transiting debris in exoplanetary systems.",79,3,2019,10.3847/1538-4357/ab05ba,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab05ba,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Ye, QZ, Granvik, M, (2019).

Two deflection options, kinetic impactor (KI) and ion beam shepherd (IBS), are studied and compared on the basis of deflection performance, safety, as well as mission schedule and political aspects. Firstly, we propose the launch of a medium-size rendevous spacecraft equipped with at least two ionic thrusters that can serve as propulsion means for the interplanetary trajectory up to rendezvous with the asteroid and as contactless actuators for a possible follow-up deflection mission. The asteroid, whose uncertainty ellipsoid is initially too large to establish whether (and how) it should be deflected, is reached by the rendezvous spacecraft after a low-thrust interplanetary trajectory of reasonable duration. Following rendezvous the spacecraft is placed in the vicinity of the asteroid to estimate its mass, study its structure and composition and, crucially, reduce its uncertainty ellipsoid by ground tracking to confirm or rule out an impact. Assuming that an impact is confirmed two main deflection scenarios are considered based on the actual asteroid size. Ion beam deflection is considered with the possibility of full deflection (the asteroid misses the Earth by a safe margin) or impact location adjustment (the impact footprint is diplaced to the nearest unpopulated region) depending on the asteroid size and the predicted impact location. The launch of a kinetic impactor mission is also considered with the employment of the rendezvous spacecraft to measure the deflection outcome and possibly to refine the deflection in case it is needed. The deflection performance of the two methods is compared.",11,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.12.031,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.12.031,Engineering,"Bombardelli, C, Calero, EJ, Gonzalo, JL, (2019).

At that time, it was considered by some as the first representative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that an artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a quarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and the new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its origin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of its current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body simulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few decades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth''''s gravity as a minimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991-1992; although it has been a recurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of the Earth. A realistic NEO orbital model predicts that objects like 1991 VG must exist and, consistently, we have found three other NEOs-2001 GP(2), 2008 UA(202) and 2014 WA(366) -which are dynamically similar to 1991 VG.

Each spacecraft is equipped with a fibre laser and a solar concentrator. The laser induces the sublimation of a portion of the surface of the asteroid, and the resultant jet of gas and debris thrusts the asteroid off its natural course. The main idea is to have a formation of spacecraft flying in the proximity of the asteroid with all the spacecraft beaming to the same location to achieve the required deflection thrust. The paper presents the design of the formation orbits and the multi-objective optimisation of the formation in order to minimise the total mass in space and maximise the deflection of the asteroid.

Pursuant to the stand-on design, ion engines will propel the spacecraft from low-Earth orbit (LEO) to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation, the asteroid itself becomes the ''propellant'''; thus a very modest spacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a system of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity tractor. DE-STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m diameter) asteroid with a 15-year targeting time. The mission fits within the rough mission parameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and size and has much greater capability for planetary defense than current proposals and is readily scalable to the threat.

We propose a stand-off, Earth-orbiting system capable of vaporizing the surface of asteroids as a futuristic but feasible approach to impact risk mitigation. We call the system DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation). DE-STAR is a modular phased array of laser amplifiers, powered by solar photovoltaic panels. Low-cost development of test systems is possible with existing technology. Larger arrays could be tested in sub-orbital demonstrations, leading eventually to an orbiting system. Design requirements are established by seeking to vaporize the surface of an asteroid, with ejected material creating a reaction force to alter the asteroid''''s orbit. A proposed system goal would be to raise the surface spot temperature to >3,000K, evaporating all known substances. Engagement distance required for successful diversion depends on the asteroid''''s mass, composition and approach velocity. Distance to focus and desired surface spot temperature then determine laser array size. Volatile-laden objects (such as comets) similar to 100m wide and approaching at 5km/s could be diverted by initiating engagement at similar to 0.05AU, requiring a laser array of similar to 100m side length. Phased array configuration allows multiple beams, so a single DE-STAR of sufficient size would be capable of targeting several threats simultaneously. An orbiting DE-STAR could serve diverse scientific objectives, such as propulsion of kinetic asteroid interceptors or other interplanetary spacecraft. Vaporization of debris in Earth orbit could be accomplished with a similar to 10m array. Beyond the primary task of Earth defense, numerous functions are envisioned.",47,,2013,10.1117/12.2026401,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2026401,Optics; Physics,"Hughes, GB, Lubin, P, Bible, J, Bublitz, J, Arriola, J, Motta, C, Suen, J, Johansson, I, Riley, J, Sarvian, N, Wu, J, Milich, A, Oleson, M, Pryor, M, (2013).

Numerous risk mitigation strategies have been described, most involving dedicated missions to a threatening object. We propose an orbital planetary defense system capable of heating the surface of potentially hazardous objects to the vaporization point as a feasible approach to impact risk mitigation. We call the system DE-STAR for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation. DE-STAR is a modular phased array of kilowatt class lasers powered by photovoltaic''''s. Modular design allows for incremental development, test, and initial deployment, lowering cost, minimizing risk, and allowing for technological co-development, leading eventually to an orbiting structure that would be developed in stages with both technological and target milestones. The main objective of DE-STAR is to use the focused directed energy to raise the surface spot temperature to similar to 3,000K, allowing direct vaporization of all known substances. In the process of heating the surface ejecting evaporated material a large reaction force would alter the asteroid''''s orbit. The baseline system is a DE-STAR 3 or 4 (1-10km array) depending on the degree of protection desired. A DE-STAR 4 allows for asteroid engagement starting beyond 1AU with a spot temperature sufficient to completely evaporate up to 500-m diameter asteroids in one year. Small asteroids and comets can be diverted/evaporated with a DE-STAR 2 (100m) while space debris is vaporized with a DE-STAR 1 (10m).",10,,2013,10.1117/12.2030228,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2030228,Optics; Physics,"Lubin, P, Hughes, GB, Bible, J, Bublitz, J, Arriola, J, Motta, C, Suen, J, Johansson, I, Riley, J, Sarvian, N, Clayton-Warwick, D, Wu, J, Milich, A, Oleson, M, Pryor, M, Krogen, P, Kangas, M, (2013).

Such orbits are crucial inputs to a variety of investigations, such as those that seek to discern how well and how early a particular asteroid survey can detect impactors, or to understand the progression of impact probability as an object is tracked after discovery. We will describe our method, which relies on Opik''''s b-plane formalism, and place it in context with previous approaches. While the Opik framework assumes the restricted three body problem with a circular Earth orbit, our final synthetic impactors are differentially corrected to ensure an impact in the N-body dynamics of the solar system. We also test the validity of the approach through brute force numerical tests, demonstrating that the properties of our synthetic impactor population are consistent with the underlying Near-Earth Object (NEO) population from which it is derived. The impactor population is, however, distinct from the NEO population, not only by virtue of the proximity of the asteroid orbit to that of the Earth, but also because low encounter velocities are strongly favored. Thus the impacting population has an increased prominence of low inclination and low eccentricity orbits, and Earth-like orbits in particular, as compared to the NEO population as a whole.",6,,2019,,,,Engineering,"Chesley, SR, Valsecchi, GB, Eggl, S, Granvik, M, Farnocchia, D, Jedicke, R, (2019).

DevOps fuses software development and operations to form a tight feedback loop during software construction and release deployment. The team has established and implemented a DevOps architecture that has already benefited the DART mission, including successful integration testing with NASA''''s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster-Commercial (NEXT-C) electric propulsion system. This DevOps architecture consists of several key components: a Software-In-The-Loop (SWIL) environment that acts as a spacecraft on a laptop, enabling a scalable automated test program, a Continuous Integration (CI) regiment that provides rapid feedback during the daily development workflow, and a Continuous Delivery (CD) practice that enables single click deployment of the latest flight software to DART''''s Hardware-In-The-Loop (HWIL) testbeds.

This paper presents basic ideas behind a directed energy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to impart a deflecting force on the target. A conceptual philosophy called DE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploration, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other papers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as a reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a directed energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high surface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an ejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the object. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses conventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the spacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation, the asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest spacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a system of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity tractor. DE-STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m diameter) asteroid with a 1- to 15-year targeting time (laser on time) depending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission parameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and size. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than current proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect all known threats with sufficient warning.

Directed energy has evolved dramatically recently and is on an extremely rapid ascent technologically. It is now feasible to consider DE systems for threats from asteroids and comets. DE-STAR (Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation) is a phased-array laser directed energy system intended for illumination, deflection and compositional analysis of asteroids [1]. It can be configured either as a stand-on or a distant stand-off system. A system of appropriate size would be capable of projecting a laser spot onto the surface of a distant asteroid with sufficient flux to heat a spot on the surface to approximately 3,000 K, adequate to vaporize solid rock. Mass ejection due to vaporization creates considerable reactionary thrust to divert the asteroid from its orbit. DE-STARLITE is a smaller stand-on system that utilizes the same technology as the larger standoff system, but with a much smaller laser for a dedicated mission to a specific asteroid. DE-STARLITE offers a very power and mass efficient approach to planetary defense. As an example, a DE-STARLITE system that fits within the mass and size constraints of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) system in a small portion of the SLS block 1 launch capability is capable of deflecting an Apophis class (325 m diameter) asteroid with sufficient warning. A DE-STARLITE using the full SLS block 1 launch mass can deflect any known threat.",19,,2015,,,,Engineering,"Kosmo, K., Lubin, P., Hughes, G.B., Griswold, J., Zhang, Q. and Brashears, T., 2015, March.

What are the bulk properties of the regolith and deep interior? And what are the physical processes that shape asteroid internal structures? Is the composition and size distribution observed on the surface representative of the bulk? These questions are crucial to understand small bodies'''' history from accretion in the early Solar System to the present, and direct measurements are needed to answer these questions for the benefit of science as well as for planetary defense or exploration. Radar is one of the main instruments capable of sounding asteroids to characterize internal structure from sub-meter to global scale. In this paper, we review the science case for direct observation of the deep internal structure and regolith of a rocky asteroid of kilometer size or smaller. We establish the requirements and model dielectric properties of asteroids to outline a possible instrument suite, and highlight the capabilities of radar instrumentation to achieve these observations. We then review the expected science return including secondary objectives contributing to the determination of the gravitational field, the shape model, and the dynamical state.

This article analyses the polemic construction and negotiation of risk in the Swedish controversy over the use of antibacterial silver in health care and consumer products. This debate engages the media, government agencies, parliament and government, non-governmental organizations and companies. Texts and websites from these actors were studied using content analysis. Antibacterial silver is construed by some actors as a risk object with harmful effects on a series of objects at risk: the environment, public health, organisms and sewage treatment. In contrast, other actors deny that antibacterial silver is a risk object, instead construing it as mitigating risk. In such a schema, antibacterial silver is conceived of as managing the risk objects of bacteria and micro-organisms, in turn managing the risk objects of infection, bad smell and washing, and in turn helping the environment and public health (objects at risk). The structure of the debate suggests two basic modes of risk communication. First, antibacterial silver is construed as a risk object, endangering a variety of objects at risk, such as organisms, public health, the environment and sewage treatment. Second, this association between antibacterial silver and objects at risk is obstructed, by denying that antibacterial silver is a risk object or by associating silver with the benefit of mitigating risk.",59,1,2015,10.1080/13669877.2013.879492,,http://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2013.879492,Social Sciences - Other Topics,"Boholm, M, Arvidsson, R, Boholm, A, Corvellec, H, and Molander, S, (2015).

At that time, it was considered by some as the first representative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that an artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a quarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and the new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its origin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of its current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body simulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few decades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth -„¢s gravity as a minimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991í¢â‚¬-œ1992; although it has been a recurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of the Earth. A realistic NEO orbital model predicts that objects like 1991 VG must exist and, consistently, we have found three other NEOs í¢â‚¬-œ 2001 GP2, 2008 UA202 and 2014 WA366 í¢â‚¬-œ which are dynamically similar to 1991 VG. All this evidence confirms that there is no compelling reason to believe that 1991 VG is not natural",,9,2017,,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stx2545,,"de la Fuente Marcos, C. and de la Fuente Marcos, R., 2018.

DISCUS will be operated either as an independent mission or accompanying a larger one. It is designed to determine the internal macroporosity of a 260-600 m diameter Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) from a few kilometers distance. The main goal will be to achieve a global penetration with a low-frequency signal as well as to analyze the scattering strength for various different penetration depths and measurement positions. Moreover, the measurements will be inverted through a computed radar tomography (CRT) approach. The scientific data provided by DISCUS would bring more knowledge of the internal configuration of rubble pile asteroids and their collisional evolution in the Solar System. It would also advance the design of future asteroid deflection concepts. We aim at a single-unit (1U) radar design equipped with a half-wavelength dipole antenna. The radar will utilize a stepped frequency modulation technique the baseline of which was developed for ESA''''s technology projects GINGER and PIRA. The radar measurements will be used for CRT and shape reconstruction. The CubeSat will also be equipped with an optical camera system and laser altimeter to support navigation and shape reconstruction. We provide the details of the measurement methods to be applied along with the requirements derived from the known characteristics of rubble pile asteroids. Additionally, an initial design study of the platform and targets accessible within 20 lunar distances are presented. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of dormant comets is difficult as they are observationally indistinguishable from their asteroidal counterparts, however, they may have produced dust during their final active stages which potentially are detectable today as weak meteor showers at the Earth. Here we present the result of a reconnaissance survey looking for dormant comets using 13 567 542 meteor orbits measured by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). We simulate the dynamical evolution of the hypothetical meteoroid streams originated from 407 near-Earth asteroids in cometary orbits that resemble orbital characteristics of Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Out of the 44 hypothetical showers that are predicted to be detectable by CMOR, we identify five positive detections that are statistically unlikely to be chance associations, including three previously known associations. This translates to a lower limit to the dormant comet fraction of 2.0 +/- 1.7 per cent in the NEO population and a dormancy rate of similar to 10(-5) yr(-1) per comet. The low dormancy rate confirms disruption and dynamical removal as the dominant end state for near-Earth JFCs. We also predict the existence of a significant number of meteoroid streams whose parents have already been disrupted or dynamically removed.",105,11,2016,10.1093/mnras/stw1846,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw1846,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Ye, Q, Brown, PG, and Pokorny, P, (2016).

The heliocentric trajectory is evaluated using various objective functions, including a search for the latest possible Earth escape date, the shortest time of flight, and the maximum impact energy. Also included in the search is the potential to use Earth gravitational assists, which proves not to offer any useful advantages. Anew way to assess the trajectory''''s margin for missed thrust is used, which quantifies the ability of the spacecraft to recover its mission following unplanned nonthrusting events, such as safe mode. The baseline trajectory is shown to be capable of recovering from missed-thrust events lasting 14 days using only 1% of its propellant as margin.

Scheduled to launch in June 2021, the DART spacecraft will autonomously intercept Didymos B in October 2022, altering the orbit period of Didymos B with respect to Didymos A. The impact will occur when the Earth-Didymos range is close enough to allow observation by Earth-based optical and radio telescopes. The spacecraft will be guided to the impact by its on-board autonomous real-time system Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation (SMART Nav). In addition, DART is carrying a 6U CubeSat provided by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI). The CubeSat will provide imagery documentation of the impact, as well as in situ observation of the impact site and resultant ejecta plume. The development is currently in Phase C, with mission Critical Design Review (CDR) planned for summer 2019. It is a substantial challenge to navigate the DART spacecraft to a hypervelocity impact with the Didymos secondary. The DART spacecraft will carry an ion propulsion system with the NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster Commercial (NEXT-C) engine, which provides flexibility in trajectory design to achieve the desired Didymos arrival conditions. The trajectory maximizes the asteroid deflection with an arrival velocity of 6 km/s relative to Didymos-B, while maintaining a proximity to Earth that allows both observation of the impact, and sufficient communication gain to recover imagery of the target upon the approach. Additionally, NEXT-C allows the mission an opportunity to fly by another asteroid and characterize SMART Nav performance seven months prior to its use for the Didymos impact. The DART spacecraft carries 22 m(2) solar arrays to generate the similar to 3.5 kW needed to power the NEXT-C engine. These long arrays introduce substantial flexible body motion to the spacecraft. This motion must be managed carefully to maintain the DART narrow angle camera on the target asteroid, even while performing the necessary autonomous Delta V maneuvers required to intercept the target. Guidance to Didymos B is further complicated by having to switch targets late in the approach, as SMART Nav must target the primary asteroid initially, as the secondary is too small to be resolved by the narrow angle camera until similar to 1 hour prior to impact. Shadowing of both primary and secondary set by arrival lighting makes it challenging to impact at the center of Didymos B. The spacecraft streams images back to Earth in real time, up until impact.",10,,2019,,,,Engineering,"Adams, E, O'Shaughnessy, D, Reinhart, M, John, J, Congdon, E, Gallagher, D, Abel, E, Atchison, J, Fletcher, Z, Chen, M, Heistand, C, Huang, P, Smith, E, Sibol, D, Bekker, D, Carrelli, D, (2019).

We have studied numerically the origin and dynamical evolution of the asteroid (25143) Itokawa on which a Japanese space probe landed and may have collected a sample. The return to Earth is planed in 2010. Methods. To estimate the most probable source of Itokawa, we have used the most recent model of the Near-Earth Object population, which allows us to relate the orbital parameters of a NEO to the different identified source regions of the NEO population. Results. The two source regions that are the most likely to transport an object to Itokawa''''s orbit are the nu(6) secular resonance in the main belt and at a lower level of probability the Mars-crosser population. This result is consistent with the spectral characteristics of Itokowa, identified as S-type, which is the dominant spectral type of objects in these sources. In a previous study, we had found that its most likely fate may be an impact with the Earth on a million year timescale. Here, we show that its evolution is consistent with the typical evolution of asteroids coming from the identified source and which are extracted in the Earth-crossing zone by planetary encounters. Conclusions. We conclude that Itokawa is a typical NEO, which probably arrived at its orbit from the main belt through the nu(6) channel. It belongs to the most common spectral-type in the inner Solar System. Therefore, unless this asteroid had a peculiar collisional history, the data obtained by the satellite Hayabusa will clarify some properties representative of the S-type NEO population.",14,4,2006,10.1051/0004-6361:20054319,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20054319,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Michel, P, Yoshikawa, M, (2006).

Both the relative position and attitude of the two collectors should be accurately controlled to achieve the desired optical path. First, the dynamical equation of the relative motion of the two collectors in the vicinity of the asteroid is modeled. Secondly, the nonlinear sliding-mode method is employed to design a control law to achieve the desired configuration of the two collectors.

A conventional EGT consists of collected asteroidal mass collocated with the spacecraft. Because of the presence of a tether, the collected mass is placed where the EGT would have been without a tether, and the spacecraft is placed farther away from the asteroid. Doing so improves the fuel efficiency and safety margin of the EGT operation without significantly sacrificing the gravitational attraction between the asteroid and the EGT. The tether is modeled as a series of particles connected by spring-dashpot systems. Physical properties of the tether are selected to be similar to those of the SPECTRA-1000, Kevlar-29, and Kevlar-49 fibers. It is assumed that control is applied only to the spacecraft, and there is no active control associated with the collected mass. A Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller is employed to maintain the spacecraft and the collected mass at desired positions relative to the asteroid. Numerical simulations of tethered EGT operations at 2008 EV5, Itokawa, Apophis, and a fictitious ellipsoidal asteroid are performed. It is demonstrated that a PD controller is capable of accomplishing the control objectives. The gravity gradient and the control force keep the tether stretched throughout a normal tethered EGT operation, and the load on the tether is well within the design limit of the tether material. While including multiple particles in the tether model is essential in capturing details of tether vibration, the number of particles does not significantly affect the motions of the collected mass and the spacecraft. In addition, the distance from the asteroid mass center to the collected mass should be chosen judiciously in the case of a rotating slender asteroid; some distance ranges should be avoided as excessive lateral oscillations can be excited by resonance between the asteroid rotation and tether pendular motion.",21,,2018,,,,Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,"Shen, HJ, Roithmayr, CM, Li, YY, (2018).

To date, most small bodies exploration has involved short timescale flybys that execute prescripted data collection sequences. Light time delay means that the spacecraft must operate completely autonomously without direct control from the ground, but in most cases the physical properties and morphologies of prospective targets are unknown before the flyby. Surface features of interest are highly localized, and successful observations must account for geometry and illumination constraints. Under these circumstances onboard computer vision can improve science yield by responding immediately to collected imagery. It can reacquire bad data or identify features of opportunity for additional targeted measurements.

One concern regarding directed energy deflection approaches is that asteroids rotate as they orbit the Sun. Asteroid rotation reduces the average thrust and changes the thrust vector imparting a time profile to the thrust. A directed energy system must deliver sufficient flux to evaporate surface material even when the asteroid is rotating. Required flux levels depend on surface material composition and albedo, thermal and bulk mechanical properties of the asteroid, and asteroid rotation rate. In the present work we present results of simulations for directed energy ejecta-plume asteroid threat mitigation. We use the observed distribution of asteroid rotational rates, along with a range of material and mechanical properties, as input to a thermal-physical model of plume generation.

The Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission project in collaboration between NASA and ESA aims to perform an asteroid deflection demonstration, using a half-ton projectile that will perform a hypervelocity impact on the surface of the secondary of the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos, called hereafter Didymoon. We performed numerical simulations of the post-impact dynamics of the ejecta cloud in the framework of the current mission scenario of AIDA. Our analysis relies on a classification of the orbits as a function of the ejecta fates, e.g., a collision with one of the binary components or the escape from the region of influence of the system. A grid search of launching sites of ejecta was defined over the globe of Didymoon, and considering a wide range of possible ejection speeds, we determined the dependency of ejecta fate on launching sites (projectile impact sites) and speeds. This range enables us to track all the complex cases that include different types of dynamical fates. The results reveal the detailed proportions of the ejecta that are either orbiting, escaping or re-accreting on the primary/secondary at the end of the considered timescale, as a function of the ejection speed, which allows us to explore the global characteristics of the ejecta dynamical fates. Two major mechanisms are found to be working broadly during the post-ejection evolution of the ejecta cloud: 1) ejecta on mean motion resonance orbits with Didymoon produce long-term quasi-periodic showers onto Didymoon over at least a couple of weeks after the projectile impact, 2) ejecta on non-resonant orbits produce a rapid and high re-accretion flux. This rapid and high flux occurs just once because ejecta on such orbits leave the system unless they experience a collision during their first encounter. For both mechanisms, swing-bys of Didymoon are found to occur. These swing-bys are a source of chaotic motion because the outcome of the swing-by is extremely sensitive to the ejecta initial conditions. Moreover, for all ejecta speeds, a zone free of ejecta is noticed to emerge around the mid-latitude zone of the celestial sphere about two months after the projectile impact. Also, the extent of this zone depends on the ejecta speed. For the second part of this study, we performed full-scale simulations of the ejecta cloud released from 6 hypothetical impact sites. To define the initial conditions of the ejecta based on cratering scaling laws, we considered two kinds of material composing Didymoon''''s subsurface and then combined a power-law size distribution of the ejecta with an ejection speed distribution. We find that the ejecta cloud evolution can be divided in two periods. It starts with a first violent period (<10 h) with fast reaccretion or ejection of the ejecta from the system. A second period is found to be more sensitive to the launching site than the first one. During this second period, ejecta will either re-accrete or being ejected from the system, depending both on their sizes and on their average survival time in close proximity of the binary components. There is thus a size-sorting effect dictated by the solar radiation pressure, which proves to be efficient to move out of the system the dust-size ejecta (<1 mm) for all considered launching sites and material types. On the other hand, the larger ejecta, being less or not affected by the solar radiation pressure, can survive longer in the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It allows a spacecraft to generate a thrust without consuming any reaction mass. The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of a spacecraft with such a propulsion system to deflect an asteroid with a high relative velocity away from an Earth collision trajectory. To this end, we formulate a simulation model for the electric solar wind sail. By summing thrust vectors exerted on each tether, a dynamic model which gives the relation between the thrust and sail attitude is proposed. Orbital maneuvering by fixing the sail''''s attitude and changing tether voltage is considered. A detailed study of the deflection of fictional asteroids, which are assumed to be identified 15 years before Earth impact, is also presented. Assuming a spacecraft characteristic acceleration of 0.5 mm/s (2), and a projectile mass of 1,000 kg, we show that the trajectory of asteroids with one million tons can be changed enough to avoid a collision with the Earth.

We locate escape routes from the main asteroid belt, particularly into the near-Earth-object (NEO) region, and estimate the relative fluxes for different escape routes as a function of object size under the influence of the Yarkovsky semimajor-axis drift. Methods. We integrated the orbits of 78 355 known and 14 094 cloned main-belt objects and Cybele and Hilda asteroids (hereafter collectively called MBOs) for 100 Myr and recorded the characteristics of the escaping objects. The selected sample of MBOs with perihelion distance q > 1.3 au and semimajor axis a < 4.1 au is essentially complete, with an absolute magnitude limit ranging from H-V < 15. 9 in the inner belt (a < 2.5 au) to HV < 14.4 in the outer belt (2.5 au < a < 4.1 au). We modeled the semimajor- axis drift caused by the Yarkovsky force and assigned four different sizes ( diameters of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 km) and random spin obliquities (either 0 deg or 180 deg) for each test asteroid. Results. We find more than ten obvious escape routes from the asteroid belt to the NEO region, and they typically coincide with low-order mean-motion resonances with Jupiter and secular resonances. The locations of the escape routes are independent of the semimajor-axis drift rate and thus are also independent of the asteroid diameter. The locations of the escape routes are likewise unaffected when we added a model for Yarkovsky-O''Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) cycles coupled with secular evolution of the rotation pole as a result of the solar gravitational torque. A Yarkovsky- only model predicts a flux of asteroids entering the NEO region that is too high compared to the observationally constrained flux, and the discrepancy grows larger for smaller asteroids. A combined Yarkovsky and YORP model predicts a flux of small NEOs that is approximately a factor of 5 too low compared to an observationally constrained estimate. This suggests that the characteristic timescale of the YORP cycle is longer than our canonical YORP model predicts.",64,2,2017,10.1051/0004-6361/201629252,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629252,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Granvik, M, Morbidelli, A, Vokrouhlicky, D, Bottke, W, Nesvorny, D, and Jedicke, R, (2017).

From these data, we have produced a series of empirical relations between the far-field acoustic signature of the bolide shocks and meteor source energies by correlating infrasonic observations of those fireballs which are also detected by earth-observing satellites. Adopting a similar approach as has been previously employed for man-made explosives, signal properties such as acoustic amplitude, signal energy/power and signal-to-noise ratio, are shown, after high-altitude wind corrections, to be useful tools in estimating the kinetic energy of a bolide. Comparison of bolide infrasound data to ground-based explosive tests show that the acoustic amplitudes from airwaves generated by small bolide events (< 7 kt TNT equivalent) attenuate more rapidly than nuclear or chemical explosions. As well, acoustic amplitude values for bolides are systematically lower than acoustic amplitudes measured for equivalent ground-based explosions. This is interpreted to be largely due to bolide acoustic sources being at high altitudes in the atmosphere. We find from our analysis that these heights are on average located between 20 and 30 km. Larger events (> 7 kt) mimic man-made explosions in terms of range dependence, but offset in amplitude equivalent to similar to 20 km source altitudes. This is consistent with instrumental observations of fireballs and the expectation that larger meteoroids (greater than a few meters in diameter), should penetrate deeper into the atmosphere on average. Applying these new relationships to historical events, we find that the August 3, 1963 bolide detected infrasonically near the Prince Edward Islands off the coast of South Africa, previously estimated to have an energy of 1100 kt, may have had a much smaller energy of 266 90 kt. This energy revision brings the infrasonically determined Near Earth Object (NEO) influx rate into much better agreement with that determined more recently using satellite and telescopic survey data.

The main objectives of AIDA are twofold: (1) to perform an asteroid deflection test by means of a kinetic impactor under detailed study at NASA (called DART, for Double Asteroid Redirection Test); and (2) to investigate with Hera the changes in geophysical and dynamical properties of the target binary asteroid after the DART impact. This joint mission will allow extrapolating the results of the kinetic impact to other asteroids and therefore fully validate such asteroid deflection techniques. Hera leverages technology and payload pre-developments of the previous AIM, and focuses on key measurements to validate impact models such as the detailed characterisation of the impact crater. As such, AIDA will be the first documented deflection experiment and binary asteroid investigation. In particular, it will be the first mission to investigate a binary asteroid, and return new scientific knowledge with important implications for our understanding of asteroid formation and solar system history. Hera will investigate the smallest asteroid visited so far therefore providing a unique opportunity to shed light on the role cohesion and Van der Waals forces may play in the formation and resulting internal structure of such small bodies.

In particular, the case of deflection by means of solar-pumped laser ablation is studied here in detail. The basic idea behind laser ablation is that of inducing a sublimation of the NEO surface, which produces a low thrust thereby slowly deviating the asteroid from its initial Earth threatening trajectory. This work investigates the integrated design of the space-based laser system and the deflection action generated by laser ablation under uncertainty. The integrated design is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem in which the deviation is maximised and the total system mass is minimised. Both the model for the estimation of the thrust produced by surface laser ablation and the spacecraft system model are assumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainties (partial or complete lack of knowledge). Evidence Theory is used to quantify these uncertainties and introduce them in the optimisation process. The propagation of the trajectory of the NEO under the laser-ablation action is performed with a novel approach based on an approximated analytical solution of Gauss'''' variational equations. An example of design of the deflection of asteroid Apophis with a swarm of spacecraft is presented.",46,10,2012,10.1007/s10569-012-9423-1,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s10569-012-9423-1,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Mathematics,"Zuiani, F, Vasile, M, Gibbings, A, (2012).

However, there have been few experimental studies to support this claim. The theoretical models are currently based on assumptions regarding the laser beam diameter, the power requirement, the formation of the ejects plume, and the potential for ejects to contaminate and otherwise degrade any exposed surface. Recent proposals suggesting the use of a solar pumped laser, in particular, can be deeply affected by the re-condensation of the ejecta. To either validate, amend and/or eliminate these assumptions a series of laser ablation experiments have been performed. Using a 90 W, continuous-wave laser operating at 808 nm, a rocky magnesium iron silica based material - olivine - has been ablated. These experiments were used to examine the validity of the theoretical model and the experienced levels of contamination. It will be shown that the current model correctly predicts the ablated mass flow rate for rocky based asteroids, but overestimates the contamination rate and the degradation of the optics.

Many objects smaller than 1 km have high albedos (greater than or similar to 0.35), but few objects larger than 1 km have high albedos.

Examining NEO albedos also sheds light on the differences between the NEO and Main Belt populations. We combine albedo results from the ExploreNEOs Warm Spitzer Exploration Science program with taxonomic classifications from the literature, publicly available data sets, and new observations from our concurrent spectral survey to derive the average albedos for C-, D-, Q-, S-, V-, and X-complex NEOs. Using a sample size of 118 NEOs, we calculate average albedos of 0.29(-0.04)(+0.05), 0.26(-0.03)(+0.04), and 0.42(-0.11)(+0.13) for the Q-, S-, and V-complexes, respectively. The averages for the C-and D-complexes are 0.13(-0.05)(+0.06) and 0.02(-0.01)(+0.02), but these averages are based on a small number of objects (five and two, respectively) and will improve with additional observations.

The Kinetic Impactor (KI) deflection technique, considered the most mature and cost effective approach for deflecting SSSBs, gained more credibility following the numerous studies performed (Don Quijote, NEOShield-2, preparations for DART mission,...) and last but not least the successful targeting of the Deep Impact (DI) spacecraft into comet 9P/Tempel 1. A dual-launch concept Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) with KI (DART) and an Explorer spacecraft (AIM) is currently under study by the ESA and NASA. While one of the more mature deflection options, there are still a significant number of poorly constrained aspects of the KI deflection technique. Of particular interest are the complex ejecta cloud dynamics that can have a considerable impact on the deflection efficiency better known as the momentum enhancement effect. Understanding the beta factor is considered paramount as it bears the potential of overall mission reduction cost and is inherently linked to SSSB geotechnical properties. Therefore, measuring this enhancement effect will be one of the top-level scientific requirements for future demonstration missions. This paper discusses the aspects of beta estimation techniques for a mitigation demonstration mission and reveals (1) the geometric considerations of the impact trajectory and the near-Earth object (SSSB) heliocentric orbit, (2) the requirements on the impact spacecraft navigation accuracies and (3) the prerequisites on the SSSB characterisation. An illustrative scenario and results are presented where the work concludes with considerations for an asteroid mitigation demonstration mission design aiming at measuring the beta-factor.",8,,2018,,,,Engineering,"Delchambre, S, Ziegler, T, Falke, A, Johann, U, Willich, G, Janschek, K, Trigueros, CPD, (2018).

The action of planetary perturbations determining the evolution of meteoroid orbits is discussed. On an example of the calculation of secular orbital perturbations of the asteroid 2003HP32, the main regularities in variation of the orbital elements as well as of the radii-vectors of ascending and descending nodes are found. The dispersion of orbits increases with time, and meteoroid streams may generate up to eight meteor showers observed on the Earth depending on the orbit type of the parent comet. It was established that some meteoroid streams include large fragments of extinct cometary nuclei. These fragments being the members of meteoroid streams are identified among the near-Earth asteroids. Consequently, the meteoroid streams consist of not only small particles but also of large fireball-producing bodies. This fact is proved based on the example of three asteroid-meteoroid complexes revealed by the authors in recent years.",33,5,2015,10.1134/S0038094615030016,,http://doi.org/10.1134/S0038094615030016,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Babadzhanov, PB, Kokhirova, GI, Obrubov, YV, (2015).

If the active comets rapidly become dormant, with albedos comparable to those of known cometary surfaces, hundreds of such bodies should by now have been detected whereas in fact only a few have been found. If, on the other hand, they disintegrate to dust, we show here that the debris would create a bright, near-spherical zodiacal cloud and 15-30 strong annual meteor showers, also contrary to observation. Here we demonstrate that the surfaces of inactive comets, if composed of loose, fluffy organic material like cometary meteoroids, develop reflectivities that are vanishingly small in visible light.

As larger near-Earth objects (NEOs) are retired from concern by the Spaceguard Survey, as new search strategies oriented toward short-term warning are brought on line, as we understand the increasing danger from NEOs in the 15 m to 40 m size range, and in the aftermath of the 2013 Chelyabinsk impact disaster, attention necessarily must shift toward dealing with the most likely dangerous impacts, those in the range of Chelyabinsk to Tunguska. Appropriate responses to predicted impacts by smaller NEOs involve civil defense and emergency planning endeavors. Deflection of an NEO''''s trajectory by spacecraft impact, or other means, is becoming a less likely type of mitigation than evacuation. We need more research on the environmental and human consequences of diverse types of hypervelocity NEOs interacting with the Earth''''s atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces.

These facts contribute to increasing the risk of meteoroid strikes on Earth, making its proper quantification difficult. The identification and subsequent study of groups of small NEOs that appear to move in similar trajectories are necessary steps in improving our understanding of the impact risk associated with meteoroids. Here, we present results of a search for statistically significant dynamical groupings among the NEO population. Our Monte Carlo-based methodology recovers well-documented groupings like the Taurid Complex or the one resulting from the split comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, and new ones that may have been the source of past impacts. Among the most conspicuous are the Mjolnir and Ptah groups, perhaps the source of recent impact events like Almahata Sitta and Chelyabinsk, respectively. Meteoroid 2014 AA, that hit the Earth on 2014 January 2, could have its origin in a marginally significant grouping associated with Bennu.

One weak point of gravitational tractor is that the deflection capability is limited by the mass and propellant of the spacecraft. To enhance the deflection capability, formation flying solar sail gravitational tractor is proposed and its deflection capability is compared with that of a single solar sail gravitational tractor. The results show that the orbital deflection can be greatly increased by increasing the number of the sails. The formation flying solar sail gravitational tractor requires several sails to evolve on a small displaced orbit above the asteroid. Therefore, a proper control should be applied to guarantee that the gravitational tractor is stable and free of collisions.

The comet was subsequently lost due to unfavorable observing circumstances during its next apparition followed by a close encounter with Jupiter in 1779. Since then, the fate of D/Lexell has attracted interest from the scientific community, and now we revisit this long-standing question. We investigate the dynamical evolution of D/Lexell based on a set of orbits recalculated using the observations made by Charles Messier, the comet''''s discoverer, and find that there is a 98% chance that D/Lexell remains in the solar system by the year of 2000. This finding remains valid even if a moderate non-gravitational effect is imposed. Messier''''s observations also suggest that the comet is one of the largest known near-Earth comets, with a nucleus of. 10. km in diameter. This implies that the comet should have been detected by contemporary NEO surveys regardless of its activity level if it has remained in the inner solar system. We identify asteroid 2010 JL(33) as a possible descendant of D/Lexell, with a 0.8% probability of chance alignment, but a direct orbital linkage of the two bodies has not been successfully accomplished. We also use the recalculated orbit to investigate the meteors potentially originating from D/Lexell.

The goal of the project is to provide two fully robotic telescopes, which will serve as prototypes for development of a future network. The system consists of two telescopes, one in Spain and the second one in the Southern Hemisphere. The telescope is a fast astrograph with a large Field of View (FoV) of 2.5 x 2.5 square-degrees and a plate scale of 2.2 arcsec/pixel. The tube is mounted on a fast direct-drive mount moving with speed up to 20 degrees per second. The focal plane hosts a 2-port 4K x 4K back-illuminated CCD with readout speeds up to 1MHz per port. All these characteristics ensure good survey performance for transients and fast moving objects. Detection software and hardware are optimised for the detection of NEOs and objects in high Earth orbits (objects moving from 0.1-40 arcsec/second). Nominal exposures are in the range from 2 to 30 seconds, depending on the observational strategy. Part of the validation scenario involves the scheduling concept integrated in the robotic operations for both sensors. Every night it takes all the input needed and prepares a schedule following predefined rules allocating tasks for the telescopes. Telescopes are managed by RTS2 control software, that performs the real-time scheduling of the observation and manages all the devices at the observatory. 1 At the end of the night the observing systems report astrometric positions and photometry of the objects detected. The first telescope was installed in Cebreros Satellite Tracking Station in mid-2015. It is currently in the commissioning phase and we present here the first results of the telescope.

An existing observational bias strongly favours the detection of ETNOs with arguments of perihelion close to 0 degrees and 180 degrees yet no objects have been found at 180 degrees. No plausible explanation has been offered so far to account for this unusual pattern. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of comet 96P/Machholz 1, a bizarre near-Earth object (NEO) that may provide the key to explain the puzzling clustering of orbits around argument of perihelion close to 0 degrees recently found for the population of ETNOs. Comet 96P/Machholz 1 is currently locked in a Kozai resonance with Jupiter such that the value of its argument of perihelion is always close to 0 degrees at its shortest possible perihelion (highest eccentricity and lowest inclination) and about 180 degrees near its shortest aphelion (longest perihelion distance, lowest eccentricity and highest inclination). If this object is a dynamical analogue (albeit limited) of the known ETNOs, this implies that massive perturbers must keep them confined in orbital parameter space. Besides, its future dynamical evolution displays orbital flips when its eccentricity is excited to a high value and its orbit turns over by nearly 180 degrees, rolling over its major axis. This unusual behaviour, that is preserved when post-Newtonian terms are included in the numerical integrations, may also help understand the production of NEOs on retrograde orbits.",35,1,2015,10.1093/mnras/stu2230,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu2230,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Marcos, CD, Marcos, RD, Aarseth, SJ, (2015).

F.; Bottke, W. F.",Observ Cote Azur,USA,,ASTEROIDS; VESTA; OPPORTUNITIES; DISRUPTION,"1996 FG(3) is a binary near-Earth object (NEO) that was likely formed during a tidal disruption event. Our results indicate that the formation of this binary object was unlikely to have occurred when the progenitor had a encounter velocity with the Earth significantly smaller than its Current value (10.7 km/s); The formation of the binary object on an orbit similar to the present one is possible, and the Survival of the satellite constrains this to have happened less than 1.6 Ma ago. However, the binary object could also have been formed when the progenitor''''s encounter velocity with Earth was > 12 km/s, and in this case we cannot constrain its formation age. Our results indicate that tidal disruptions occurring among NFOs with low velocity encounters with Earth are unlikely to produce long-lasting NEO binaries. Thus, tidal disruption may not be able to completely re-supply the observed Population. This would imply that a significant fraction of the observed NEO binaries evolved out of the main asteroid belt. Overall, our results suggest to us that the CM2 meteorites having cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages of similar to 200,000 yr were likely liberated by the tidal disruption of a primitive NEO with a relative velocity with the Earth significantly smaller than that of 1996 FG(3).

The model establishes the relative contribution of these sources to the NEO population. By computing the albedo distribution of the bodies in and/or near each of the five sources, we can deduce the albedo distribution of the NEO population as a function of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. A problem with this strategy, however, is that we do not know a priori the albedo distribution of main belt asteroids over the same size range as observed NEOs (diameter D < 10 km). To overcome this problem, we determined the albedo distribution of large asteroids in and/or near each NEO source region and used these results to deduce the albedo distribution of smaller asteroids in the same regions. This method requires that we make some assumptions about the absolute magnitude distributions of both asteroid families and background asteroids. Our solution was to extrapolate the observed absolute magnitude distributions of the families up to some threshold value H-thr, beyond which we assumed that the families'''' absolute magnitude distributions were background-like. We found that H-thr = 14.5 provides the best match to the color vs heliocentric distance distribution observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this value of H-thr our model predicts that the debiased ratio between dark and bright (albedo smaller or larger than 0.089) objects in any absolute-magnitude-limited sample of the NEO population is 0.25 +/- 0.02. Once the observational biases are properly taken into account, this agrees very well with the observed C/S ratio (0.165 for H < 20). The dark/bright ratio of NEOs increases to 0.87 +/- 0.05 if a size-limited sample is considered. We estimate that the total number of NEOs larger than a kilometer is 855 +/- 110, which, compared to the total number of NEOs with H < 18 (963 &PLUSMN; 120), shows that the usually assumed conversion H = 18 &DLRARR; D = 1 km slightly overestimates the number of kilometer-size objects. Combining our orbital distribution model with the new albedo distribution model, and assuming that the density of bright and dark bodies is 2.7 and 1.3 g/cm(3), respectively, we estimate that the Earth should undergo a 1000 megaton collision every 63,000 &PLUSMN; 8000 years. On average, the bodies capable of producing 1000 megaton of impact energy are those with H &LT; 20.6.

This data set includes similar to 2.5 million exposures in each of W1 and W2, effectively doubling the amount of WISE imaging available at 3.4 mu m and 4.6 mu m relative to the AllWISE release. We have created the first ever full-sky set of coadds combining all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation (NEOWISER) mission phases. We employ an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework, which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not only improve the W1/W2 depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent artifacts such as off-axis scattered moonlight. We anticipate that our new coadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection for upcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identification of distant/massive galaxy clusters, and discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our full-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will be an important input for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument selection of luminous red galaxy and quasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction pipelines.

Astronomers are faced with the daunting challenge of identifying the most scientifically important events from this flood of data in order to conduct effective and timely follow-up observations. Several ongoing observing programs have proven databases to be extremely valuable in conducting efficient follow-up, particularly when combined with tools to select targets, submit observation requests directly to ground- and space-based facilities (manual, remotely-operated and robotic), handle the resulting data, interface with analysis software and share information with collaborators. We draw on experience from a number of follow-up programs running at LCOGT, all of which have independently developed systems to provide these capabilities, including the Microlensing Key Project (RoboNet, PI: Tsapras, co-I Street), the Global Supernova Project (SNEx, PI: Howell) and the Near-Earth Object Project (NEOExchange, PI: Lister). We refer to these systems in general as Target and Observation Managers (TOMs). Future projects, facing a much greater and rapidly-growing list of potential targets, will find such tools to be indispensable, but the systems developed to date are highly specialized to the projects they serve and are not designed to scale to the LSST alert rate. We present a project to develop a general-purpose software toolkit that will enable astronomers to easily build TOM systems that they can customize to suit their needs, while a professionally-developed codebase will ensure that the systems are capable of scaling to future programs.",19,,2018,10.1117/12.2312293,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2312293,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Computer Science; Optics,"Street, RA, Bowman, M, Saunders, ES, Boroson, T, (2018).

First, the impact probability of each VI is projected onto the surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection considers orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. Second, the global population distribution is introduced and represents the exposure to the hazard. Finally, the vulnerability of the population to the physical impact effects produced by a colliding asteroid is calculated. Impact effects are calculated based on asteroid size, impact speed and impact angle and the effects are: crater formation, thermal radiation, seismic shaking, overpressure shock wave, strong winds and the deposition of an ejecta blanket. Population vulnerability is determined based on the severity of the impact effects at a given distance from the impact site. Factoring together impact probability, exposure and vulnerability allows calculation of the risk for each VI as well as the combined risk of the 69 asteroids. To account for the uncertainty in the impact effect models, ARMOR produces three scenarios that represent the least harmful, the expected and the worst case outcomes. Because the risk calculation is dependent on the current impact probability, the risk calculation is subject to significant variability based on the availability of new asteroid observations. The calculated risk expresses the current best estimate of expected casualties that are associated with each asteroid. The method has the potential to form the basis of a new impact hazard threat presented in the form of global spatial risk distributions and as quantitative analysis.",36,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Rumpf, C, Lewis, HG, Atkinson, PM, (2016).

473,J,RISK MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,t,Global vulnerability to near-Earth object impact,Article,"Bailey, N; Swinerd, G; Lewis, H; Crowther, R","Bailey, Nicholas J.; Swinerd, Graham G.; Lewis, Hugh G.; Crowther, Richard",University Southampton; University Southampton; University Southampton; Rutherford Appleton Lab,UK,near-Earth object; global hazard; global vulnerability; impact simulation,TSUNAMI,"A clear appreciation of the consequences resulting from an asteroid impact is required in order to understand the near-Earth object (NEO) hazard. Three main processes require modelling to analyse the entire impact event. These are the atmospheric entry phase, land impact events and ocean impact events. A range of impact generated effects (IGEs) are produced by different impact scenarios. It is these IGEs that present the threat to human populations worldwide, and the infrastructure they utilise. A software system for analysing the NEO threat has been developed, entitled NEOimpactor, to examine the social and economic consequences from land and ocean impacts. Existing mathematical models for the three principal impact processes have been integrated into one complete system, which has the capability to model the various effects of a terrestrial asteroid impact and, critically, predict the consequences for the global population and infrastructure. Analysis of multiple impact simulations provides a robust method for the provision of an integrated, global vulnerability assessment of the NEO hazard. The primary graphical outputs from NEOimpactor are in the form of ''''relative consequence'''' maps, and these have been designed to be comprehensible to a non-specialist audience. By the use of a series of multiple-impact simulations, the system has identified the five countries most at risk from the impact hazard, as well as indicating the various factors influencing vulnerability.

These observations provide information on surface characteristics, orbits, rotations, and polar ices for a wide variety of solar system objects. The resulting data are used not just for scientific studies of these objects, but also for frequent support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flight projects, including many solar system exploration missions over the last three decades. For example, the GSSR has contributed to the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), Cassini, Hayabusa (MUSES-C), MESSENGER, NEAR, SOHO recovery, Mars Pathfinder, Lunar Prospector, Clementine, Magellan, and Viking. Other recent examples include measurement of lunar topography at high resolution near the lunar south pole, which is of particular interest concerning the impact site of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission, and the characterization and orbit refinement of near-Earth asteroids, both for asteroid impact hazard mitigation and for identification of potential targets for future spacecraft missions.

By introducing the satellite''''s inertia integrals, a model of its gravitational force and torque up to the fourth order is established in the form of explicit formulations. Some interesting conclusions about the model are reached. These conclusions are useful in truncating the planet''''s gravitational field and the satellite''''s inertia integrals with the demanded precision of the gravitational force and torque given. Then the equations of motion are presented. With a special rigid satellite consisted of 36 point masses, two simulation examples are carried out by using the exact and approximate models of the gravitational force and torque. By comparisons between the errors of different order approximate models, the effects of the planet''''s harmonic coefficients and the satellite''''s inertia integrals are investigated in detail. The orbit-rotation coupling is assessed. In the case of a natural satellite around a planet, the second-order inertia integrals are the main perturbation of the rotational motion. The perturbation of the satellite''''s inertia integrals on the orbital motion, which is more significant than the perturbation of the planet''''s harmonic coefficients J4, should be taken into account. It is shown that in the case of a large spacecraft around a small asteroid the orbit-rotation coupling is very severe, and higher-order inertia integrals of the spacecraft have significant effects on motion.",8,1,2014,10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000222,,http://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000222,Engineering,"Wang, Y, Xu, SJ, (2014).

As a test survey, we select the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We use its proposed pointings for a 10-year mission, and model the detection of NEOs in the fields. We discuss individual model parameters for magnitude losses, vignetting, fading, asteroid rotation and colors, fill factor, limiting magnitude, rate of motion, field shape and rotation, and survey patterns. We assess results in terms of the cumulative completeness of the detected population as a function of size and time. Additionally, we examine the sources of modeling uncertainty, and derive the overall NEO population completeness for the baseline LSST survey to be 55 +/- 5% for NEOs with absolute magnitude brighter than 22. Including already discovered objects and ongoing surveys, the NEO completeness at the end of the LSST baseline survey should reach similar to 77%.",38,7,2017,10.3847/1538-3881/aa73d1,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa73d1,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Veres, P, and Chesley, SR, (2017).

NEO orbital model. They found a discrepency between the detected and expected Aten inclination distribution. We show that the more recent NEO orbital distribution model by Greenstreet et al., when biased using the NEOWISE detection biases, gives a better match to the NEOWISE detections for the Aten (a < 1.0 AU, Q > 0.983 AU) population in semimajor axis (a), eccentricity (e), and inclination (i) than the Bottke et al. model. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives the probability of drawing the NEOWISE detections from the biased Bottke et al. model as not rejectable (at > 99% confidence) for the Aten semimajor axis distribution, but is rejectable at such a high level of confidence for the Aten eccentricity and inclination distributions. For all three orbital element distributions, the biased Greenstreet et al. model provides an acceptable match to the NEOWISE Aten detections. The deficiency in the previous model is likely due to the numerical integration''''s accuracy having broken down in the high-speed regime for planetary encounters near the Sun, an effect which the newer model does not suffer, and thus likely is the model of preference for perihelia q < 1.0 AU.",10,4,2013,10.1088/2041-8205/767/1/L18,,http://doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/767/1/L18,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Greenstreet, S, Gladman, B, (2013).

Among the meteorites the coupling was greatest for the Fe-Ni, which maintained physical integrity, and lowest for the stony meteorites, all of which disintegrated. Using particle velocity measurements, shock results are interpreted in terms of target fragmentation, inhomogeneity, and microstructural characteristics which are the dominant target parameters effecting energy and momentum coupling. Normalized values for the shocked material velocity and peak pressure in the targets compare favorably to similar experimental work on Al targets.

The size, density, strength curve, entry angle, and velocity of the meteors were varied to cover the parameter space of airbursts of interest to planetary defense in general which encompasses the Tunguska event in particular. The hydrocode simulations were used to calibrate a simple analytical model that can be used to quickly estimate the burst height of an incoming asteroid or comet. The hydrocode simulations show both rocky asteroids and icy comets are plausible Tunguska meteors, over a wide range of sizes, speeds, entry angles, at least in terms of the energy delivered and height of burst required to produce the tree-fall, and the lack of an obvious impact crater on the ground. This agrees with previous analytical estimates and hydrocode simulations of hypothetical Tunguska meteors, and provides a complete range of possibilities. Modelling of the tree wind resistance predicts windspeeds of 40-50 m/s are required to fell most of the trees. This is slower than previous estimates from nuclear test data, but faster than lower bound estimates from a 3 Mt blast. It suggests an energy of 10 Mt is most likely for Tunguska, but requires missing tree size distribution and wind response data to better narrow the probability distribution of potential Tunguska impactors.",67,7,2019,10.1016/j.icarus.2018.10.017,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.10.017,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Robertson, DK, Mathias, DL, (2019).

Numerical simulations using porous targets,Article,"Jutzi, M; Michel, P","Jutzi, Martin; Michel, Patrick",University Bern; University Nice Sophia Antipolis,Switzerland; France,"Asteroids, surfaces; Collisional physics; Cratering",BODIES; POROSITY,"In this paper, we investigate numerically the momentum transferred by impacts of small (artificial) projectiles on asteroids. The study of the momentum transfer efficiency as a function of impact conditions and of the internal structure of an asteroid is crucial for performance assessment of the kinetic impactor concept of deflecting an asteroid from its trajectory. The momentum transfer is characterized by the so-called momentum multiplication factor beta, which has been introduced to define the momentum imparted to an asteroid in terms of the momentum of the impactor. Here we present results of code calculations of the beta factor for porous targets, in which porosity takes the form of microporosity and/or macroporosity. The results of our study using a large range of impact conditions indicate that the momentum multiplication factor beta is small for porous targets even for very high impact velocities (beta < 2 for nu(rmp) <= 15 km/s), which is consistent with published scaling laws and results of laboratory experiments (Holsapple, K.A., Housen, KR. [2012]. Icarus 221, 875-887: Holsapple, K.A., Housen, KR. [2013]. Proceedings of the IAA Planetary Defense Conference 2013, Flagstaff, USA). It is found that both porosity and strength can have a large effect on the amount of transferred momentum and on the scaling of beta with impact velocity. On the other hand, the macroporous inhomogeneities considered here do not have a significant effect on beta. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

One of the goals of these networks is to provide the necessary information for linking meteorites to their pre-impact, heliocentric orbits and ultimately to their source regions in the solar system. We re-compute heliocentric orbits for the 25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these orbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid belt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the near-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery efficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are comparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in escape-route identification is explored for the first time. Moreover, our improved size-dependent delivery model substantially changes likely escape routes for several meteorite falls, most notably Tagish Lake which seems unlikely to have originated in the outer main belt as previously suggested. We find that reducing the uncertainty of fireball velocity measurements below similar to 0.1 km/s does not lead to reduced uncertainties in the identification of their escape routes from the asteroid belt and, further, their ultimate source regions. This analysis suggests that camera networks should be optimized for the largest possible number of meteorite recoveries with measured speed precisions of order 0.1 km/s. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Thus the population of observable NEOs, in principle, gives important representation of meteorite source bodies. By linking meteorites to NEOs, and linking NEOs to their most likely main-belt source locations, we seek to gain insight into the original Solar System formation locations for different meteorite classes. To forge possible links between meteorites and NEOs, we have developed a three dimensional method for quantitative comparisons between laboratory measurements of meteorites and telescopic measurements of near-Earth objects. We utilize meteorite spectra from the Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) database and NEO data from the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Using the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) as a mathematical tool, we treat asteroid and meteorite spectra identically in the calculation of 1-mu m and 2-mu m Geometric Band Centers and their Band Area Ratios (BARs). Using these identical numerical parameters we quantitatively compare the spectral properties of S-, Sq-, Q- and V-type NEOs with the spectral properties of the meteorites in four classes: H, L, LL and HED. For each NEO spectrum, we assign a set of probabilities for it being related to each of these four meteorite classes. Our NEO-meteorite correlation probabilities are then convolved with NEO-source region probabilities to yield a final set of meteorite-source region correlations. While the v6 resonance dominates the delivery for all four meteorite classes, an excess (significant at the 2.1-sigma level) source region signature is found for the H chondrites through the 3:1 mean motion resonance. This results suggest an H chondrite source with a higher than average delivery preference through the 3:1 resonance. A 3:1 resonance H chondrite source region is consistent with the short cosmic ray exposure ages known for H chondrites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The identification of asteroid families within the NEO population could provide a similar boon to studies of their formation and interiors. In this study we examine the purported identification of NEO families by Drummond [Drummond, J.D., 2000.

Strategies to deflect an asteroid include impacting it with a spacecraft (a kinetic impactor), pulling it with the gravity of the mass of a spacecraft (a gravity tractor), using the blast of a nearby nuclear explosion, and modifying the surface or causing ablation by various means including lasers or particle beams. None of these approaches has been tested on a NEO. The AIDA mission is a proposed international collaboration to demonstrate kinetic deflection, the most mature technique for mitigating the impact hazard of a Near Earth Object (NEO). AIDA consists of two mission elements, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission and the ESA Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). The main objectives of the DART mission, which includes the spacecraft kinetic impact and an Earth-based observing campaign, are to: Perform a full scale demonstration of the spacecraft kinetic impact technique for deflection of an asteroid, by targeting an object large enough to qualify as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (that is, larger than 100 m); Measure the resulting asteroid deflection, by targeting the secondary member of a binary NEO and measuring the period change of the binary orbit; Understand the hypervelocity collision effects on an asteroid, including the long-term dynamics of impact ejecta; validate models for momentum transfer in asteroid impacts, inferring physical properties of the asteroid surface and sub-surface. The DART target is the secondary member of the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos, with the impact scheduled to occur in September, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the Didymos binary at similar to 7 km/s will alter the binary orbit period by at least 4 minutes, assuming a simple transfer of momentum to the target. The period change may be significantly greater, as the momentum transferred to the target asteroid may exceed the incident momentum of the kinetic impactor, possibly by a large factor. The AIM spacecraft will characterize the asteroid target and monitor results of the impact in situ at Didymos, but the period change can be determined accurately solely with ground-based observatories, an approach that is only feasible because of the choice of a binary system as target. DART held its Mission Concept Review on May 21, 2015. At MCR, the DART concept had only expensive and potentially risky launch options. During Phase A, the project explored the possibility of being a secondary payload on a commercial Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) launch with electric propulsion (EP) as an approach to reduce mission cost, eliminate the launch vehicle risk, and demonstrate the NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) engine. NASA determined that DART would use this approach, and the EPbased concept was presented at the DART System Requirements Review on Aug 30, 2016. This paper summarizes the trade that resulted in adoption of the new design.",7,,2017,,,,Engineering,"Kantsiper, B, (2017).

This measure estimates the probability of a space system to deflect a single randomly generated Earth-impacting object to a safe distance from the Earth. This represents a measure of efficiency that is not biased by the orbital parameters of a test-case object. A vast number of virtual Earth-impacting scenarios are investigated by homogenously distributing in orbital space a grid of 17,518 Earth-impacting trajectories. The relative frequency of each trajectory is estimated by means Opik''''s theory and Bottke''''s near-Earth objects model. A design of the entire mitigation mission is performed and the largest deflected asteroid computed for each impacting trajectory. The minimum detectable asteroid can also be estimated by an asteroid survey model. The results show that current technology would likely suffice against discovered airburst and local damage threats, whereas larger space systems would be necessary to reliably tackle impact hazard from larger threats.

This paper focuses on the terminal phase of such impact mission, analyzing the capability of autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) systems to compensate the deviations in the impact point to achieve a successful collision. The autonomous GNC system employs the information of the optical sensors to estimate the parameters allowing the computation of divert maneuvers to achieve the impact. GMV has developed a simulator, with different levels of sophistication, and a set of different GNC algorithms to help in the design process. This tool is used for different purposes such as: dimensioning the sensors and actuators, verifying mission requirements, computing figures of merit of different SC configurations and evaluating GNC performances. Four GNC algorithms are compared: low-thrust proportional navigation using a fading memory filter, high-thrust predictive guidance using either a Kalman filter or a batch-sequential least-squares filter, and a mid-thrust hybrid predictive-proportional guidance using a fading memory filter. Monte Carlo analysis using global-performances models of the optical sensors for each of these GNC algorithms are presented for two different asteroids (1989 ML and 2002 AT4), showing the mission parameters driving the mission performances.

The accurate estimation of the impact probability of hazardous asteroids is extremely important for planetary defense mission planning. Asteroids in Earth resonant orbits are particularly troublesome because of the continuous threat they pose in the future. Based on the trajectories of the asteroid and the Earth, feasible mission trajectories can be found to mitigate the impact threat of hazardous asteroids. In order to try to ensure mission success, trajectories are judged based on initial and final mission design parameters that would make the mission easier to complete. Given the potential of a short-warning time scenario, a disruption mission considered in this paper occurs approximately one year prior to the anticipated impact date. Expanding upon the established theory, a computational method is developed to estimate the impact probability of the hazardous asteroid, in order to assess the likelihood of an event, and then investigate the fragmentation of the asteroid due to a disruption mission and analyze its effects on the current and future encounters of the fragments with Earth. A fictional asteroid, designated as 2015 PDC - created as an example asteroid risk exercise for the 2015 Planetary Defence Conference, is used as a reference target asteroid to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of computational tools being developed for impact risk assessment and planetary defense mission planning for a hazardous asteroid or comet.

The deflection of an asteroid through laser ablation is achieved by illuminating the surface of the asteroid with high intensity laser light. The absorbed energy induces the sublimation of the surface material and the generation of a plume of gas and ejecta. Similar to a rocket engine, the flow of expelled material produces a continuous and controllable thrust that could be used to modify the trajectory and tumbling motion of the asteroid. Recent results gained from a series of laser ablation experiments were used to improve the sublimation and deflection models. In each experiment a terrestrial olivine sample was ablated, under vacuum, with a 90 W continuous wave laser. The paper presents a model that better fits the outcomes of the experimental campaign, in particular in terms of mass flow rate and spot temperature. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The ratio of the momentum change of the target to the impact momentum is commonly denoted as beta, the momentum enhancement factor. Knowledge of what values of beta to expect for impacts into near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the range of size and composition representative of objects in the known population of PHOs is thus crucial in designing and planning for mitigation strategies focused on the kinetic impact method. We present results of laboratory impact experiments, conducted with targets ranging in size from decimeter to meter size scales and measuring beta in the process. Our impact experiments utilize the Southwest Research Institute''''s (SwRI) 50-mm powder gun, which can fire up to 260-g mass projectiles at speeds of similar to 2 km/s, supplemented by smaller-scale experiments using the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range (AVGR) as necessary to study a parameter space that includes projectile mass, speed, composition, impact angle as well as target mass composition and temperature. Targets are mounted to allow recoil (on a conventional ballistic pendulum) and all impact experiments are documented by high-speed video allowing the required analysis to quantify impact outcome and target recoil. To date we have completed 29 small-scale shots at the AVGR and 24 large-scale shots with the SwRI 50-mm powder gun. AVGR experiments include 13 shots into 10.2-cm and 15.2-cm right cylinders composed of a plaster-sand mix as a porous silicate asteroid analog, two shots into 15.2-cm pumice cubes, and 14 shots into 10.2cm right cylinders of an iron-nickel alloy approximating the composition of iron meteorites. beta values of similar to 1-2 and similar to 1.3 were obtained for the plaster-sand mix and the pumice, respectively, and similar to 1.7-2 for the iron-nickel shots, performed at temperatures of about 297 K and 149 K, thus spanning the ductile to-brittle fracture transition. For the metal target shots we see what appears to be a trend to higher beta for higher speed shots and for the cryo shots. SwRI 50-mm powder gun shots were conducted with large pieces of pumice, concrete, and sandstone impacted with 2.54-cm and 4.45-cm aluminum projectiles at impact speeds of similar to 2.0 km/s. Although the pumice targets do not show a size scale effect and data from the sandstone shots are still being analyzed, the concrete material does show a significant size scale effect. Additional shots are planned for meter-scale targets composed of the same plaster-sand mix previously shot at decimeter scale at the AVGR.",37,11,2019,10.1016/j.pss.2019.07.008,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2019.07.008,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Durda, DD, Walker, JD, Chocron, S, Housen, KR, Grosch, DJ, Marchi, S, Flynn, GJ, Strait, MM, (2019).

Dynamic Logic algorithm, derived from Modeling Field Theory, has made significant improvements in detection, tracking, and fusion of ground radar images. As an extension to this, the research in this paper will examine Dynamic Logic''''s ability to detect NEOs with minimal human-in-the-loop intervention.

The trajectory of the deflecting spacecraft from Earth escape to asteroid deviation is determined to maximize the miss distance at the asteroid''''s closest approach to the Earth. A procedure to find mission opportunities is developed and applied to both ballistic and electric propulsion trajectories. The optimization method proves to be robust and efficient. A large number of deflection opportunities are found with limited computational effort. The comparison of results shows the benefit that the use of electric propulsion can provide with respect to ballistic trajectories; high-performance trajectories, which move far from the sun and become retrograde, are enabled. Counterintuitive effects related to asteroid inclination are also highlighted.",31,3,2012,10.2514/1.54732,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.54732,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,"Casalino, L, Simeoni, F, (2012).

The NRC reported to Congress that nuclear explosives are the only current technology to protect the Earth from impact of large asteroids, This is mainly due to difficulties in predicting the impact with high confidence leading to a short time to impact, Thus, the velocity deflection required when they are determined to he potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA) can only he achieved with nuclear explosives. A standoff explosion, without direct contact with the Near Earth Object (NEO) is a robust option for a non-destructive push, which offers several advantages. We have investigated the efficiency of energy deposition and its dependence on porosity and strength properties of NEO. An Eulerian hydrocode (GEODYN) with an interface reconstruction algorithm, wide-range equation of states and a flexible constitutive model library was used for numerical studies. The largest difficulties in predicting deflection velocity and fragmentation of asteroids are related to uncertainty in composition and mechanical properties of NEO. To reduce this uncertainty, we performed simulations of normal impact cratering of an NEO surface and related results with observables such as the crater shapes, the critical crater diameter (necessary to remove previous craters) and the maximum crater size (necessary for asteroid break-up). The velocity distribution of the material ejected from the impact crater is also germane to the asteroid deflection problem where the ablated material provides the thrust resulting in a deflection velocity. We performed parametric studies on how porosity and strength of the asteroid would affect these results. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This extraordinary event, detected by 17 infrasonic stations of the global International Monitoring Network, generated stratospherically ducted infrasound returns at distances up to 17 500 km, the greatest range at which infrasound from a fireball has been detected since the 1908 Tunguska explosion. From these infrasonic records, we find the total source energy for this bolide as 8-67 kilotons of TNT equivalent explosive yield, with the favored best estimate near similar to 50 kt. Global impact events of such energy are expected only once per decade and study of their impact effects can provide insight into the impactor threshold levels for ground damage and climate perturbations.

Asteroids with semi-major axes very close to that of a host planet can avoid node crossings when their nodal points are at perihelion and at aphelion. This layout protects the asteroids from close encounters, and eventual collisions, with the host planet. Aims. Here, we study the short-term dynamical evolution of four recently discovered near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) - 2012 FC71, 2014 EK24, 2014 QD(364), and 2014 UR - that follow very Earth-like orbits. Methods. Our analysis is based on results of direct N-body calculations that use the most updated ephemerides and include perturbations from the eight major planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon system, and the three largest asteroids. Results. These four NEAs exhibit an orbital evolution unlike any other known near-Earth object (NEO). Beyond horseshoe, tadpole, or quasi-satellite trajectories, they follow co-orbital passing orbits relative to the Earth within the Kozai domain. Our calculations show that secular interactions induce librations of their relative argument of perihelion with respect to our planet but also to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Secular chaos is also present. The size of this transient population is probably large. Conclusions. Although some of these NEAs can remain orbitally stable for many thousands of years, their secular dynamics are substantially more complicated than commonly thought and cannot be properly described within the framework of the three-body problem alone owing to the overlapping of multiple secular resonances. Objects in this group are amongst the most atypical NEOs regarding favourable visibility windows because these are separated in time by many decades or even several centuries.",54,8,2015,10.1051/0004-6361/201526108,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201526108,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Marcos, CD, Marcos, RD, (2015).

In support of this goal, a study was conducted to identify the initial considerations for performing the navigation and flight dynamics tasks of this mission class. Although missions to a NEO are not new, the unique factors involved in human spaceflight present challenges that warrant special examination. During the cruise phase of the mission, one of the most challenging factors is the noisy acceleration environment associated with a crewed vehicle. Additionally, the presence of a human crew necessitates a timely return trip, which may need to be expedited in an emergency situation where the mission is aborted. Tracking, navigation, and targeting results are shown for sample human-class trajectories to NEOs. Additionally, the benefit of in-situ navigation beacons on robotic precursor missions is presented. This mission class will require a longer duration flight than Apollo and, unlike previous human missions, there will likely be limited communication and tracking availability. This will necessitate the use of more onboard navigation and targeting capabilities. Finally, the rendezvous and proximity operations near an asteroid will be unlike anything previously attempted in a crewed spaceflight. The unknown gravitational environment and physical surface properties of the NEO may cause the rendezvous to behave differently than expected. Symbiosis of the human pilot and onboard navigation/targeting are presented which give additional robustness to unforeseen perturbations.",10,,2011,,,,Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,"Holt, GN, Getchius, J, and Tracy, WH, (2011).

The search for minor planets resumed on 2013 December 23, and the first new near-Earth object (NEO) was discovered 6 days later. As an infrared survey, NEOWISE detects asteroids based on their thermal emission and is equally sensitive to high and low albedo objects; consequently, NEOWISE-discovered NEOs tend to be large and dark. Over the course of its three-year mission, NEOWISE will determine radiometrically derived diameters and albedos for similar to 2000 NEOs and tens of thousands of Main Belt asteroids.

It has a spectral signature consistent with primitive carbonaceous chondrites, and an orbit similar to that of the Earth. A plausible evolution scenario for Bennu is that it migrated inward across the inner main belt from a low albedo family by Yarkovsky thermal forces over many hundreds of Myr. Eventually, it entered a resonance that took it into the terrestrial planet region, where a combination of planetary encounters and resonances took it to its current orbit over a few Myr to tens of Myr. When it departed the main belt, Bennu probably had an eccentricity 0.1 < e < 0.2 and an inclination 1 degrees < i < 6 degrees. Several low albedo families have the appropriate dynamical, color, albedo, and broad spectral characteristics to produce Bennu: Clarissa, Erigone, Eulalia, New Polana, and Sulamitis. Here we used a suite of numerical simulations to determine the ages of the families above, how Bennu reached its current orbit, and the most probable source family for Bennu. Specifically, we tracked test Bennu-like asteroids evolving in semimajor axis by the coupled Yarkovsky/YORP effects, incorporating a new formalism for how YORP torques modify the spin vector evolution of small asteroids. Using results and insights provided by Statler (Statler, T.S. [2009]. Icarus 202, 502-513), we assumed that modest shape changes to asteroids, produced by a variety of processes (e.g., crater formation, changes to asteroid rotational angular momentum by YORP), caused the test asteroids'''' spin rates, but not their obliquities, to undergo a random walk.

This paper describes the relation of an object''''s self-energy to its collisional disruption energy, and shows how to determine an object''''s self-energy from its internal gravitational potential. Any solid object can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a polyhedron of sufficient complexity. An analytic formula is known for the gravitational potential of any homogeneous polyhedron, but it is widely believed that this formula applies only on the surface or outside of the object. Here we show instead that this formula applies equally well inside the object. We have used these formulae to develop a numerical code which evaluates the self-energy of any homogeneous polyhedron, along with the gravitational potential and attraction both inside and outside of the object, as well as the slope of its surface. Then we use our code to find the internal, external, and surface gravitational fields of the Platonic solids, asteroid (216) Kleopatra, and comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as well as their surface slopes and their self-gravitational energies. We also present simple spherical, ellipsoidal, cuboidal, and duplex models of Kleopatra and comet 67P, and show how to generalize our methods to inhomogeneous objects and magnetic fields.

These objects are ideal candidates for deep-space operations and explorations as we extend the human presence out into the solar system. The notion of a crewed mission to a NEO was first discussed in the Apollo era. The most recent assessment has been undertaken by the Advanced Projects Office within NASA''''s Constellation Program. This particular study examined the feasibility of sending NASA''''s new Orion spacecraft (also referred to as the crew exploration vehicle, or CEV) to a NEO. Depending on the specifications of spacecraft and integrated components, a mission profile would include two or three astronauts on a 90- to 180-day spaceflight; including a 7- to 14-day stay at the NEO itself. These missions to NEOs provide exploration with an excellent suite of benefits: operational experience beyond cislunar space, risk reduction for space hardware, confidence building for future mission scenarios, in situ resource utilization evaluation, as well as a rich scientific return. This incremental step along the way towards Mars would mark humanity''''s first foray beyond the Earth-Moon system.

C-M are derived from equations of state (EOS) variables and serve as figures of merit to determine energy efficiency conversion into target momentum. Generally, C-M are proportional to the inverse of the interaction speed and related variables for each interaction regime. This approach provides a formalism allowing computation of hitherto intractable HED radiation and mechanical momentum coupling interactions encountered in astrophysics, planetary physics, inertial confinement fusion, near-Earth object hazard mitigation, and HED explosives modeling. C-M is generally not scale invariant as are the hydrodynamic Euler equations.

This impact released about 500 kilotons TNT of energy, injured over 1500 people, and caused extensive property damage. The Chelyabinsk impact served as a dramatic reminder of the asteroid impact hazard and re-emphasized the importance of discovering hazardous Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and learning how to mitigate the threat they pose. Mitigation of a hazardous NEO can be accomplished by deflecting it so that it misses the Earth. Strategies to deflect an asteroid include impacting it with a spacecraft (a kinetic impactor), pulling it with the gravity of the mass of a spacecraft (a gravity tractor), using the blast of a nearby nuclear explosion, and modifying the surface or causing ablation by various means including lasers or particle beams. None of these approaches has been tested on a NEO. The AIDA mission is a proposed international collaboration to demonstrate kinetic deflection, the most mature technique for mitigating the impact hazard of a Near Earth Object (NEO). AIDA consists of two mission elements, the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission and the ESA Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM). The main objectives of the DART mission, which includes the spacecraft kinetic impact and an Earth-based observing campaign, are to: Perform a full scale demonstration of the spacecraft kinetic impact technique for deflection of an asteroid, by targeting an object large enough to qualify as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid; Measure the resulting asteroid deflection, by targeting the secondary member of a binary NEO and measuring the period change of the binary orbit; Understand the hypervelocity collision effects on an asteroid, including the long-term dynamics of impact ejecta; validate models for momentum transfer in asteroid impacts, inferring physical properties of the asteroid surface and sub-surface. The DART target is the secondary member of the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos, with the impact scheduled to occur in September, 2022. The DART impact on the secondary member of the Didymos binary at similar to 7 km/s will alter the binary orbit period by at least 4 minutes, assuming a simple transfer of momentum to the target. The period change may be significantly greater, as the momentum transferred to the target asteroid may exceed the incident momentum of the U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright kinetic impactor, possibly by a large factor. The AIM spacecraft will characterize the asteroid target and monitor results of the impact in situ at Didymos, but the period change can be determined accurately solely with ground-based observatories, an approach that is only feasible because of the choice of a binary system as target. AIM is currently in Phase A. DART held its Mission Concept Review on May 21-22, 2015. This paper summarizes the DART mission concept and the path forward in Phase A.",10,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Kantsiper, B, Cheng, A, Reed, C, (2016).

Here we propose using the same basic system topology as a receiver rather than a transmitter. All of the components in the system, excluding the laser, are bidirectional. Rather than each element transmitting laser light, they would instead receive light, which would then be combined to create an interference pattern that can be imaged onto a focal plane. The Laser Array Space Telescope ( LAST) uses most of the same components and metrology as DE-STAR and could thus be integrated into a singular system, allowing both transmit and receive modes.

Previous work predicts that either a standoff burst or a very low-yield surface burst is easily capable of deflecting a large (1 km) asteroid without fragmentation. Alternatively, large near-surface or just sub-surface bursts can sufficiently disrupt and disperse smaller bodies (300 m) to ensure that large fractions (in excess of 99.99%) miss the Earth entirely. Even for very short warning times (less than a month), more than 99.5% of a body''''s mass can be deflected off of an Earth-bound trajectory. However, successfully deflecting a small body, while avoiding fragmentation, becomes a challenging problem when the required kinetic energy increment is a substantial fraction of the body''''s potential. This paper addresses the challenge of preventing the production of substantial low-speed debris while deflecting small bodies with an impulsive method. (C) 2012 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The present-day main belt, however, only contains similar to 5 x 10(-4) Earth masses. Numerical simulations suggest that this mass loss can be explained by the dynamical depletion of main belt material via gravitational perturbations from planetary embryos and a newly-formed Jupiter. To explore this scenario, we combined dynamical results from Petit et al. [Petit, J. Morbidelli, A., Chambers, J., 2001. The primordial excitation and clearing of the asteroid belt. Icarus 153, 338-3471 with a collisional evolution code capable of tracking how the main belt undergoes comminution and dynamical depletion over 4.6 Gyr [Bottke, WE, Durda, D., Nesvorny, D., Jedicke, R., Morbidelli, A., Vokrouhlicky, D., Levison, H., 2005. The fossilized size distribution of the main asteroid belt. Icarus 175, 111-140]. Our results were constrained by the main belt''''s size-frequency distribution, the number of asteroid families produced by disruption events from diameter D > 100 km parent bodies over the last 3-4 Gyr, the presence of a single large impact crater on Vesta''''s intact basaltic crust, and the relatively constant lunar and terrestrial impactor flux over the last 3 Gyr. We used our model to set limits on the initial size of the main belt as well as Jupiter''''s formation time. We find the most likely formation time for Jupiter was 3.3 +/- 2.6 Myr after the onset of fragmentation in the main belt. These results are consistent with the estimated mean disk lifetime of 3 Myr predicted by Haisch et al. [Haisch, K.E., Lada, E.A., Lada, C.J., 2001. Disk frequencies and lifetimes in young clusters. Astrophys. J. 553, L153-L156]. The post-accretion main belt population, in the form of diameter D less than or similar to 1000 km planetesimals, was likely to have been 160 +/- 40 times he current main belt''''s mass. This corresponds to 0.06-0.1 Earth masses, only a small fraction of the total mass thought to have existed in the main belt zone during planet formation. The remaining mass was most likely taken up by planetary embryos formed in the same region. Our results suggest that numerous D > 200 km planetesimals disrupted early in Solar System history, but only a small fraction of their fragments survived the dynamical depletion event described above. We believe this may explain the limited presence of iron-rich M-type, olivine-rich A-type, and non-Vesta V-type asteroids in the main belt today. The collisional lifetimes determined for main belt asteroids agree with the cosmic ray exposure ages of stony meteorites and are consistent with the limited collisional evolution detected among large Koronis family members. Using the same model, we investigated the near-Earth object (NEO) population. We show the shape of the NEO size distribution is a reflection of the main belt population, with main belt asteroids driven to resonances by Yarkovsky thermal forces. We used our model of the NEO population over the last 3 Gyr, which is consistent with the current population determined by telescopic and satellite data, to explore whether the majority of small craters (D < 0.1-1 km) formed on Mercury, the Moon, and Mars were produced by primary impacts or by secondary impacts generated by ejecta from large craters. Our results suggest that most small craters formed on these worlds were a by-product of secondary rather than primary impacts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Having two different sets of asteroid observations, the goal is to identify all possible pairs of objects between the sets. An arbitrary asteroid can either remain unidentified, or be preliminary linked to one or more asteroids. In the case of ambiguity, the final decision must usually be based on additional observations. We use a multistep approach, during which possible pairs of objects are first selected by comparing ephemerides that have been generated for three common epochs. The method has been successfully tested using both Very Large Telescope observations, and simulated observations of near-Earth and main-belt objects. Identification results of simulated observations indicate that the observing strategy promoted by the Minor Planet Center might not be the best one, at least for the purposes of identification. The ultimate goal is to produce a real-time asteroid identification tool for ESA''''s astrometric space observatory Gaia, the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search, the Near-Earth Space Surveillance mission, and the Nordic Near-Earth Object Network.

One reason is to better understand their origin and the development of the solar system. Another reason is that asteroids and comets, such as those near the orbit of the Earth (commonly called Near-Earth Objects, NEOs) could possibly strike Earth. If a body were discovered on a collision course with Earth, the issue of mitigation arises. There are essentially two thoughts on mitigation: destroy it or move it out of the way. Both ideas rely on knowledge of the composition and internal structure of the asteroid or comet. In particular, the density, strength, and cohesiveness of the body need to be known. Seismology is a way to determine such information. This paper explores both explosives and impactors as seismic sources. In particular, the seismic source is quantified by downward momentum and the moment in the perpendicular directions or tangent plane. The values can be computed through large-scale numerical simulation. Computations were performed characterizing a particular explosive and an impactor against both a metal surface and a rock surface. It is shown how to produce equivalent seismic signals by both impacts and explosives. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Phased-array designs are capable of producing higher beam intensity than similar sized multi-beam emitters, and also allow beam steering and beam profile manipulation. In phased-array designs, individual emitter phases must be controllable, based on suitable feedback. Most current control schemes sample individual emitter phases, such as with an array-wide beam splitter, and compare to a master phase reference. Reliance on a global beam splitter limits scalability to larger array sizes due to lack of design modularity. This paper describes a conceptual design and control scheme that relies only on feedback from the array structure itself. A modular and scalable geometry is based on individual hexagonal frames for each emitter; each frame cell consists of a conventional lens mounted in front of the fiber tip. A rigid phase tap structure physically connects two adjacent emitter frame cells. A target sensor is mounted on top of the phase tap, representing the local alignment datum. Optical sensors measure the relative position of the phase tap and target sensor. The tap senses the exit phase of both emitters relative to the target normal plane, providing information to the phase controller for each emitter. As elements are added to the array, relative local position data between adjacent phase taps allows accurate prediction of the relative global position of emitters across the array, providing additional constraints to the phase controllers. The approach is scalable for target distance and number of emitters without loss of control.",31,,2015,10.1117/12.2189821,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2189821,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,"Steffanic, P, Johannes, BT, Sison, CA, Hughes, GB, Lubin, P, Meinhold, P, Suen, J, O'Neill, H, Kangas, M, Brashears, T, Zhang, QC, Griswold, J, Riley, J, Motta, C, (2015).

Unlike NEAs, LPCs follow nearly parabolic trajectories and approach from the distant outer solar system where they cannot be observed. An LPC on an Earth-impact trajectory is unlikely to be discovered more than a few years in advance of its arrival, even with significant advancements in sky survey detection capabilities, likely leaving insufficient time to develop and deliver an interception mission to deflect the comet. However, recent proposals have called for the development of one or more large 1 km laser arrays placed on or near Earth primarily as a means for photon propulsion of low-mass spacecraft at delta-v above what would be feasible by traditional chemical or ion propulsion methods. Such a laser array can also be directed to target and heat a threatening comet, sublimating its ices and activating jets of dust and vapor which alter the comet''''s trajectory in a manner similar to rocket propulsion. Simulations of directed energy comet deflection were previously developed from astrometric models of nongravitational orbital perturbations from solar heating, an analogous process that has been observed in numerous comets. These simulations are used together with the distribution of known LPC trajectories to evaluate the effect of an operational Earth-based laser array on the LPC impact risk.",13,,2017,10.1117/12.2274726,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2274726,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Optics,"Zhang, QC, Lubin, PM, Hughes, GB, (2017).

Submitted to ESA on July 2007 in the framework of the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025, Marco Polo passed the first evaluation process on October 2007. Seventeen Spanish researchers belonging to six Spanish institutes signed the proposal. The mission is planned to visit a primitive NEO, belonging to a class that cannot be related to known meteorite types, to characterize it at multiple scales, and to bring samples back to Earth. Marco Polo will give us the first opportunity for detailed laboratory study of the most primitive materials that formed the planets. This will allow us to improve our knowledge on the processes which governed the origin and early evolution of the Solar System, and possibly of the life on Earth. Three Spanish institutes are involved in the feasibility studies of two instruments: the THERmal MAPper (THERMAP) and the Marco Polo Camera System (MPCS).",11,,2010,10.1007/978-3-642-11250-8_19,,http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11250-8_19,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Licandro, J, (2010).

This Euro-Asian mission will go to a primitive Near-Earth Object (NEO), which we anticipate will contain primitive materials without any known meteorite analogue, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and bring samples back to Earth for detailed scientific investigation. Small bodies, as primitive leftover building blocks of the Solar System formation process, offer important clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. Current exobiological scenarios for the origin of Life invoke an exogenous delivery of organic matter to the early Earth: it has been proposed that primitive bodies could have brought these complex organic molecules capable of triggering the pre-biotic synthesis of biochemical compounds. Moreover, collisions of NEOs with the Earth pose a finite hazard to life. For all these reasons, the exploration of such objects is particularly interesting and urgent. The scientific objectives of MARCO POLO will therefore contribute to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the Solar System, the Earth, and possibly Life itself. Moreover, MARCO POLO provides important information on the volatile-rich (e.g. water) nature of primitive NEOs, which may be particularly important for future space resource utilization as well as providing critical information for the security of Earth. MARCO POLO is a proposal offering several options, leading to great flexibility in the actual implementation. The baseline mission scenario is based on a launch with a Soyuz-type launcher and consists of a Mother Spacecraft (MSC) carrying a possible Lander named SIFNOS, small hoppers, sampling devices, a re-entry capsule and scientific payloads. The MSC leaves Earth orbit, cruises toward the target with ion engines, rendezvous with the target, conducts a global characterization of the target to select a sampling site, and delivers small hoppers (MINERVA type, JAXA) and SIFNOS. The latter, if added, will perform a soft landing, anchor to the target surface, and make various in situ measurements of surface/subsurface materials near the sampling site. Two surface samples will be collected by the MSC using ''touch and go''' manoeuvres. Two complementary sample collection devices will be used in this phase: one developed by ESA and another provided by JAXA""",48,3,2009,10.1007/s10686-008-9087-8,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s10686-008-9087-8,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Barucci, MA, Yoshikawa, M, Michel, P, Kawagushi, J, Yano, H, Brucato, JR, Franchi, IA, Dotto, E, Fulchignoni, M, Ulamec, S, (2009).

If one assumes that NEOs have orbital characteristics broadly similar to meteoroids, then the orbits of the latter can give important indications concerning the conduct of search programs designed to discover large NEOs well ahead of any catastrophic impact, allowing ameliorative action to be taken. For smaller NEOs that cannot be telescopically detected until the day or so before impact, the radiant distribution of observed meteors shows the regions of the sky from which impactors are most likely to emanate. It is shown that the vast majority of meteoroids striking the Earth have geocentric (apparent) radiants within two near-ecliptic regions a few tens of degrees wide and centered on longitudes +/- 90 degrees from the apex of the Earth''''s way (the so-called helion and anti-helion sources). These are bodies with low inclinations, large eccentricities (e = 0.7 - 0.9) and quite small semimajor axes (mostly a = 1.3 - 2.5 AU). After allowing for the terrestrial motion about the Sun (conversion to the true radiant), the longitudes are around +/- 120 degrees from the apex. For a ground-based search on the nightside, the best search region is that within similar to 20 degrees of the are joining the geocentric and true radiants (longitudes 90 degrees and 120 degrees). On the dayside, proximity to the solar direction argues for a space-based surveillance program, if small NEOs are to be found just prior to impact.",74,,1997,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48333.x,,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48333.x,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Steel, D, (1997).

The spectra of some asteroids, particularly Q-types, indicate surfaces that appear young and fresh, implying they have been recently been exposed. Previous work found that Earth encounters were the dominant freshening mechanism and could be responsible for all near-Earth object (NEO) Q-types. In this work we increase the known NEO Q-type sample of by a factor of three. We present the orbital distributions of 64 Q-type near-Earth asteroids, and seek to determine the dominant mechanisms for refreshing their surfaces. Our sample reveals two important results: (i) the relatively steady fraction of Q-types with increasing semi-major axis and (ii) the existence of Q-type near-Earth asteroids with Minimum Orbit Intersection Distances (MOID) that do not have orbit solutions that cross Earth. Both of these are evidence that Earth-crossing is not the only scenario by which NEO Q-types are freshened. The high Earth-MOID asteroids represent 10% of the Q-type population and all are in Amor orbits. While surface refreshing could also be caused by Main Belt collisions or mass shedding from YORP spinup, all high Earth-MOID Q-types have the possibility of encounters with Mars indicating Mars could be responsible for a significant fraction of NEOs with fresh surfaces.

Asteroids have been exposed to impacts since their formation, and as a consequence their surfaces are covered by small particles, pebbles, and boulders. The Japanese JAXA/ISAS Hayabusa mission collected micron-sized particles from the regolith of asteroid 25143 Itokawa. The study in terrestrial laboratories of these particles provides a scientific opportunity as their physical properties can be compared with those characteristic of chondritic meteorites that are often considered proxies of the building materials of potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Methods. Here we present the results from a study of the mechanical properties of three of these particles using a precise technique called nanoindentation. The derived results are compared with those obtained via a methodology similar to that used for the Chelyabinsk meteorite. Results. The reduced Young''''s modulus values obtained for the Itokawa samples are higher than those measured for the Chelyabinsk chondrite, so these specific particles of asteroid regolith are more compacted than the minerals forming the particular LL chondrite associated with PHAs. This might be a natural consequence of particles surviving long exposure times on the surface of a (near-Earth asteroid) NEA. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission plans to excavate a crater in the surface of the (65803) Didymos satellite. Our results suggest that excavating a crater with a kinetic impactor in an area of significant fine-grained regolith will increase the momentum transfer. As this will facilitate the release of particles carrying target mass in the opposite direction to the movement of the projectile, there is no need to grind up the target during the mechanical excavation phase.",29,9,2019,10.1051/0004-6361/201935380,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201935380,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Tanbakouei, S, Trigo-Rodriguez, JM, Sort, J, Michel, P, Blum, J, Nakamura, T, Williams, I, (2019).

Being composed of a kinetic impactor, DART (NASA), and by an observing spacecraft, AIM (ESA), AIDA has been designed to deliver vital data to determine the momentum transfer efficiency of a kinetic impact onto a small body and the key physical properties of the target asteroid. This will enable derivation of the impact response of the object as a function of its physical properties, a crucial quantitative point besides the qualitative proof of the deflection. In the course of the AIM mission definition, a lander has been studied as an essential element of the overall mission architecture. It was meant to be deployed on Didymoon, the secondary body of the binary NEA system 65803 Didymos and it was supposed to significantly enhance the analysis of the body''s dynamical state, mass, geophysical properties, surface and subsurface structure. The mission profile and the design of the 13 kg (current best estimate) nano-lander have been derived from the MASCOT lander flying aboard Hayabusa2. Differing from its predecessor by having an increased lifetime of more than three months, a surface mobility capability including directed movement, a sensor system for localization and attitude determination on the surface and a redesigned mechanical interface to the mother spacecraft. The MASCOT2 instrument suite consists of a bi-static, low frequency radar as main instrument, supported by an accelerometer, a camera, a radiometer and a magnetometer; the latter three already flying on MASCOT. Besides the radar measurements, the camera is meant to provide high-resolution images of the landing area, and accelerometers to record the bouncing dynamics by which the top surface mechanical properties can be determined. During the DART impact, MASCOT2 was expected to be able to detect the seismic shock, providing valuable information on the internal structure of the body. MASCOT2 was supposed also to serve as a technology demonstrator for very small asteroid landing and extended operations powered by a solar generator. In this paper, we describe the science concept, mission analysis of the separation, descent and landing phase, the operational timeline, and the latest status of the lander''s design. Despite the fact that AIM funding has not been fully confirmed during the ESA Ministerial conference in 2016, MASCOT2 is an instrument package of high maturity and major interest for planetary defence and NEO science. With appropriate tailoring and optimization, it can be considered and studied for future missions.",17,8,2018,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.05.013,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.05.013,Engineering,"Lange, C, Biele, J, Ulamec, S, Krause, C, Cozzoni, B, Kuchemann, O, Tardivel, S, Ho, TM, Grimm, C, Grundmann, J, Wejmo, E, Schroder, S, Lange, M, Reill, J, Herique, A, Rogez, Y, Plettemeier, D, Carnelli, I, Galvez, A, Philippe, C, Kuppers, M, Grieger, B, Ferdez, JG, Grygorczuk, J, Tokarz, M, and Ziach, C, (2018).

Accurate knowledge of the beta-factor allows insight to the physical properties of the NEO and bears potential for cost reduction of future mitigation missions by lowering the required impact momentum. First, the definition of the known scalar momentum enhancement beta-factor is generalized to a matrix definition which is proven to overcome the shortcomings inherent to the scalar variant. Moreover, a clear distinction between the linear and angular momentum matrices is introduced. The new definition is shown to be consistent with the previous definitions in the literature [6][9]. Second, a measurement strategy for the beta-factor in the close proximity of very small bodies based on heliocentric orbit determination is suggested. An operational spacecraft observation concept for very small bodies (d<300 m) is suggested. The paper ultimately shows the projected performance for this measurement strategy and highlights the critical elements in this measurement chain. The concept and operational scenario is directly applicable to future missions to small bodies (e.g. joint AIDA mission of ESA/NASA and NEOShield-2).",10,,2017,,,,Engineering,"Delchambre, S, Ziegler, T, Falke, A, Johann, U, Willich, G, Janschek, K, (2017).

The mass and velocity distribution of particles ejected from the impact site determine the enhancement of the momentum transferred by the kinetic impact spacecraft to the target body. Laboratory experiments provide an important means of investigating ejecta characteristics [1] and substantially contribute to the evaluation of deflection efficiency. Scaling laws derived from dimensional analysis and experiments, performed mainly in the context of cratering research [2], have been used to assess the kinetic impact deflection technique [3], [4]. In view of future real-scale deflection missions, like the planned NASA DART impact, more dedicated experiments at relevant impact conditions may substantially contribute to analyzing impact effects, validating numerical simulations and, finally, designing a mission. We performed scaled hypervelocity experiments with impact conditions similar to currently discussed full-scale kinetic impact demonstration missions like DART. In particular, we directly measured both the ejecta characteristics and the momentum transfer in these experiments. The objective of these initial experiments was to demonstrate a novel method for individual particle tracking in the context of asteroid deflection. By determining the size and the velocity of individual particles, we can directly study their influence on the momentum enhancement, the total amount of which we measured using a well-established ballistic pendulum.",19,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.01.046,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.01.046,Engineering,"Schimmerohn, M, Watson, E, Gulde, M, Kortmann, L, Schafer, F, (2019).

The Bulirsh-Stoer and a symplectic orbit integrator gave similar results for orbital evolution, but sometimes give different collision probabilities with the Sun. For orbits close to that of Comet 2P, the mean collision probabilities of Jupiter-crossing objects with terrestrial planets were greater by two orders of magnitude than for some other comets.

The article deals with the design of a low-thrust rendezvous trajectory to the asteroid, the estimation of the propagated covariance ellipsoid and the outcome of an ion beam slow-push deflection starting from three worst case scenarios (impacts in New Delhi, Dhaka and Tehran). Displacing the impact point towards an extremely low-populated, easy-to-evacuate region, as opposed to full deflection, is found to be a more effective mitigation approach.

With laser ablation, the vaporized material is used to push the target itself allowing for a significant reduction in the mass requirement for a space mission. Specifically, this paper addresses two important issues which have remained unanswered by previous studies: the impact of the tumbling motion of the target as well as the impact of the finite thickness of the material ablated in the case of a space debris. We developed an analytical model based on energetic considerations in order to predict the efficiency range theoretically allowed by a CW laser deflection system operating under the plasma formation threshold and in absence of the two aforementioned issues. A numerical model was then developed to solve the transient heat equation in presence of vaporization and melting and assess the efficiency reduction due to the unsteadiness induced by the tumbling motion of the potentially hazardous object (PHO). The model was translated to handle the case where the target is a piece of space debris by considering specific materials such as aluminum and titanium alloys or even carbon fiber and by adapting the finite size of the computational domain along with the propagation of the ablation front. From the results of this later model, pulsed lasers appear better suited to answer the needs of a space debris de-orbiting laser system rather than CW lasers. An empirical ablation threshold is also found that establishes a direct relation between the pulse duration or the heating time (CW case), the delivered flux and the properties of the material. Derived from theoretical consideration, this threshold matches well with the predictions of our numerical model. Moreover, the numerical results are found to agree with published data of thrust coupling coefficient on targets made of aluminium and titanium alloys. In the second part of the paper, we coupled our thrust model within an orbit propagator and considered several redirect scenarios for the case of a small(56m) and a larger(100m) asteroid as well as an 8-ton defunct satellite currently orbiting in a sun-synchronous orbit at a 765km altitude. In each scenario, the laser is assumed mounted on a spacecraft that will first rendez-vous with the target and will then operate from a safe distance (500m). Based on the results, realistic mission architectures are explored. Within the last section, the paper also highlights the advantages offered in term of redundancy and scalability by techniques such as beam combining or formation flying. We show that a medium class mission carrying a CW laser system able to generate 2.4kW of output power could ensure the deflection of a 56m asteroid while a formation of such spacecraft could also achieve the deflection of a larger threat. For the debris case, our preliminary results indicate that a spacecraft carrying an actively Q-switched diodepumped solid state laser (DPSSL) able to generate 3kW of output power would bring the altitude of Envisat down to 400 kilometers in less than 500 days.",26,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Thiry, N, Vasile, M, Monchieri, E, (2016).

This paper shows three types of missions. In general, it is impossible to determine the relative orbit during flyby only with optical information. Thus, the optical navigation needs to be combined with the radio navigation that should provide the relative velocity vector information.

A constrained optimization problem is formulated based on nonlinear programming with a three-dimensional patched conic method. System dynamics are also established, considering the target ECO''''s orbit as being continuously perturbed by limited laser power. The required optimal operating duration and operating angle history of the laser ablating tool are computed for various types of ECOs to avoid an Earth impact. The available final warning time is also determined with a given limited laser power. As a result, detailed laser operating behaviors are presented and discussed, which include characteristics of operating duration and angle variation histories in relation to the operation''''s start time and target object''''s properties. The calculated durations of the optimal laser operation are also compared to those estimated with first-order approximations previous studies. It is discovered that the duration of the laser operation estimated with first-order approximations could result in up to about 50% error if the operation is started at the final warning time. The laser operation should be started as early as possible because all early start requires a short operating duration with a small operating angle variation. The mission feasibility demonstrated in the present study will give various insights into preparing future deflection missions using power limited spacecraft with a laser ablation tool.

They are diverse in physical properties and composition and are time capsules of the early solar system. This makes them strategic locations for planetary science, resource mining, planetary defense/security and as interplanetary depots and communication relays. Landing on a small asteroid and manipulating its surface materials remains a major unsolved challenge fraught with high risk. The asteroid surface may contain everything from hard boulders to soft regolith loosely held by cohesion and very low-gravity. Upcoming missions Hayabusa II and OSIRIS-REx will perform touch and go operations to mitigate the risks of `landing'' on an asteroid. This limits the contact time and requires fuel expenditure for hovering. An important unknown is the problem of getting stuck or making a hard impact with the surface. The Spacecraft Penetrator for Increasing Knowledge of NEOs (SPIKE) mission concept will utilize a small-satellite bus that is propelled using a xenon-fueled ion engine and will contain an extendable, low-mass, high-strength boom with a tip containing force-moment sensors. SPIKE will enable contact with the asteroid surface, where it will perform detailed regolith analysis and seismology as well as penetrometry, while keeping the main spacecraft bus at a safe distance. Using one or more long stilts frees the spacecraft from having to hover above the asteroid and thus substantially reduces or eliminates fuel use when doing science operations. This enables much longer missions that include a series of hops to multiple locations on the small body surface. We consider a one-legged system, modelled as an inverted pendulum, where the balanced weight is only 10-100 mN. The objective is to balance the spacecraft upon the boom-tip touching the surface. Furthermore, the spacecraft will disengage with the asteroid and hop to another location. The reaction times in the milligravity environment of a km-sized asteroid are much less stringent than the inverted pendulum task on Earth.

The modeled sensitivities show that in PING''s active mode, where both a pulsed neutron generator (PNG) and a gamma ray spectrometer (GRS) are used, PING can interrogate the material below the rover to about 20í¢â‚¬-°cm due to the penetrating nature of the high -energy neutrons and the resulting secondary gamma rays observed with the GRS.

The modeled uncertainties show that PING''s use of a PNG reduces the required observation times by an order of magnitude over a passive operating mode where the PNG is turned off. While the active mode allows for more complete elemental inventories with higher sensitivity, the gamma ray signatures of some elements are strong enough to detect in passive mode.

This paper focuses on a mitigation technique that involves the use of a long tether and ballast mass to divert an asteroid. When such a tether is modeled as massless and inelastic, results show that the method may be viable for diverting asteroids away from a collision with the Earth; the next step towards demonstrating the viability of the approach is to conduct a study which uses a more realistic tether model. This paper presents such a study, in which the tether models include tether mass and elasticity. These models verify that a tether-ballast system is capable of diverting Earth-threatening asteroids. Detailed parametric studies are presented which illustrate how system performance depends on tether mass and elasticity. Also, case studies are presented which show how more realistic models can aid in the design of tether-ballast asteroid mitigation systems. Key findings include the dangers imposed by periods during which the tether goes slack and ways to preclude this. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This increased momentum transfer is due to crater ejecta leaving the impacted body in the direction opposite to the impactor travel direction. An application for this effect is using hypervelocity impactors to deflect potentially hazardous asteroids and comet nuclei. A concern with historical work with consolidated material is the effect of porosity in the impacted body on momentum enhancement. Hypervelocity impact tests were performed of aluminum spheres striking pumice boulders. The pumice boulders ranged in mass from 70 to 486 kg and had an estimated porosity of 70 - 75%. Two different projectiles diameters were used (2.54 cm and 4.45 cm) to study the effect of size scale. Impacts occurred at roughly 2.1 km/s. Depth of penetration was measured, an estimated crater radius was measured (though the crater geometries were irregular), and momentum enhancement was measured. Significant scatter was observed in the results even though the tests were carefully controlled, with measured momentum enhancements ranging from 1 to 10.69 and the average being beta = 1.3.

The Kinetic Impactor (KI) deflection technique, considered the most mature and cost effective approach for deflecting SBs, gained credibility following both the numerous studies performed (Don Quijote, NEOShield-2, preparations for DART mission, ...) as well as the successful targeting of the Deep Impact (DI) spacecraft (S/C) into comet 9 P/Tempel 1. A dual-satellite concept AIDA with KI (DART) and an Explorer S/C (AIM/HERA) is currently under study by the ESA and NASA. While one of the more mature deflection options, there are still a significant number of poorly constrained aspects of the KI deflection technique. Of particular interest are the complex ejecta cloud dynamics that can have a considerable impact on the deflection efficiency and the according beta-factor. Understanding the momentum enhancement beta-factor is considered paramount as it bears the potential of overall mission cost reduction and is inherently linked to the SB geotechnical properties. Therefore, estimating this beta-factor is one of the top-level scientific requirements for future demonstration missions. First, this work presents a beta-factor estimation technique with the focus on an SB orbit determination (OD) filter where radioscience tracking data of an Explorer S/C at the close proximity is fused with optical navigation information. Second, an extensive error analysis is presented where the major drivers of the beta-factor error budget are identified based on a breakdown tree. The paper shows the estimation filter architecture and explicitly addresses the data fusion process. An extensive, high fidelity test campaign has been conducted to conclude on the achievable beta-factor estimation performance for a KI impactor reference scenario with the SB 2001 QC34. An end-to-end momentum enhancement factor estimation technique is presented and it was found that the beta-factor uncertainty is reduced to 0.33 (37) after only 1 week of monitoring with 67% availability of the tracking stations and a station-keeping manoeuver once a day. This estimation performance has shown that the momentum enhancement factor uncertainties can be constrained considerably and thus further advocates a KI demonstration mission.",31,10,2018,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.05.050,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.05.050,Engineering,"Delchambre, S, Ziegler, T, Falke, A, Janschek, K, (2018).

For example, when an impactor strikes a body at hypervelocities the momentum transferred to the impacted body is greater than the initial impactor momentum due to the crater ejecta. When the impacted body''''s mass provides some of the momentum change, the effect is referred to as momentum enhancement. The small amount of data on this question implies that there is a scale effect that is, as the projectile size increases there is an increase in the imparted momentum beyond that anticipated due to the increase in projectile size. Recently, experimental data was gathered on the increase in momentum caused by crater ejecta when 4.45-cm diameter aluminum spheres struck granite targets. The amount of momentum enhancement (characterized by the ratio beta) was greater than 2 for 2 km/s impacts. Compared with other data at much smaller scale, these tests imply an impactor scale and an impactor density effect for hypervelocity strikes into rock. The implied impactor size scale effect is surprisingly large to a 0.4 power and extrapolation indicates that a 1-m aluminum sphere striking a consolidated rock surface at 10 km/s could have a beta exceeding 40, though the scale size saturation may be just larger than the tests we performed, which would reduce this value. Such a potentially large momentum enhancement shows that kinetic impactors can be very efficient at deflecting asteroids. Also, the failure strain is shown to depend on the scale size to the -2/3 power. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We present an automated system called neoranger that regularly computes asteroid-Earth impact probabilities for objects on the Minor Planet ctr''s (MPC) Near-Earth-Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) and sends out alerts of imminent impactors to registered users. In addition to potential Earth-impacting objects, neoranger also monitors for other types of interesting objects such as Earth''s natural temporarily-captured satellites. Methods. The system monitors the NEOCP for objects with new data and solves, for each object, the orbital inverse problem, which results in a sample of orbits that describes the, typically highly-nonlinear, orbital-element probability density function (PDF). The PDF is propagated forward in time for seven days and the impact probability is computed as the weighted fraction of the sample orbits that impact the Earth. Results. The system correctly predicts the then-imminent impacts of 2008 TC3 and 2014 Lambda Lambda based on the first data sets available. Using the same code and configuration we find that the impact probabilities for objects typically on the NEOCP, based on eight weeks of continuous operations, are always less than one in ten million, whereas simulated and real Earth-impacting asteroids always have an impact probability greater than 10% based on the first two tracklets available.",28,9,2018,10.1051/0004-6361/201832747,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201832747,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Solin, O, and Granvik, M, (2018).

Only since the more recent recognition that 2003 EH1 moves among the Quadrantids are we certain that dormant comets are associated with meteoroid streams. Since that time, many orphan streams have found parent bodies among the newly discovered Near Earth Objects. The seven established associations pertain mostly to showers in eccentric or highly inclined orbits. At least 35 other objects are tentatively linked to streams in less inclined orbits that are more difficult to distinguish from those of asteroids. There is mounting evidence that the streams originated from discrete breakup events, rather than long episodes of gradual water vapor outgassing. If all these associations can be confirmed, they represent a significant fraction of all dormant comets that are in near-Earth orbits, suggesting that dormant comets break at least as frequently as the lifetime of the streams. I find that most pertain to NEOs that have not yet fully decoupled from Jupiter. The picture that is emerging is one of rapid disintegration of comets after being captured by Jupiter, and consequently, that objects such as 3200 Phaethon most likely originated from among the most primitive asteroids in the main belt, instead. They too decay mostly by disintegration into comet fragments and meteoroid streams. The disintegration of dormant comets is likely the main source of our meteor showers and the main supply of dust to the zodiacal cloud.",92,6,2008,10.1007/s11038-007-9169-z,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s11038-007-9169-z,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geology,"Jenniskens, P, (2008).

They are diverse in physical properties and composition and are time capsules of the early solar system. This makes them strategic locations for planetary science, resource mining, planetary defense/security and as interplanetary depots and communication relays. However, asteroids are a challenging target for surface exploration due it its low but highly nonlinear gravity field. In such conditions, mobility through ballistic hopping possess multiple advantages over conventional mobility solutions and as such hopping robots have emerged as a promising platform for future exploration of asteroids and comets. They can traverse large distances over rough terrain with the expenditure of minimum energy. In this paper we present ballistic hopping dynamics and its motion planning on an asteroid surface with highly nonlinear gravity fields. We do it by solving Lambert''''s orbital boundary value problem in irregular gravity fields by a shooting method to find the initial velocity required to intercept a target. We then present methods to localize the hopping robot using pose estimation by successive scan matching with a 3D laser scanner. Using the above results, we provide methods for motion planning on the asteroid surface over long distances. The robot will require to perform multiple hops to reach a desired goal from its initial position while avoiding obstacles.

Therefore, nanoindentation experiments on this meteorite allow us to obtain key data to understand the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Tests at different length scales provide information about the local mechanical properties of the minerals forming this meteorite: reduced Young''''s modulus, hardness, elastic recovery, and fracture toughness. Those tests are also useful to understand the potential to deflect threatening asteroids using a kinetic projectile. We found that the differences in mechanical properties between regions of the meteorite, which increase or reduce the efficiency of impacts, are not a result of compositional differences. A low mean particle size, attributed to repetitive shock, can increase hardness, while low porosity promotes a higher momentum multiplication. Momentum multiplication is the ratio between the change in momentum of a target due to an impact, and the momentum of the projectile, and therefore, higher values imply more efficient impacts. In the Chelyabinsk meteorite, the properties of the light-colored lithology materials facilitate obtaining higher momentum multiplication values, compared to the other regions described for this meteorite. Also, we found a low value of fracture toughness in the shock-melt veins of Chelyabinsk, which would promote the ejection of material after an impact and therefore increase the momentum multiplication. These results are relevant to the growing interest in missions to test asteroid deflection, such as the recent collaboration between the European Space Agency and NASA, known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission.",58,2,2017,10.3847/1538-4357/835/2/157,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/835/2/157,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Moyano-Cambero, CE, Pellicer, E, Trigo-Rodriguez, JM, Williams, IP, Blum, J, Michel, P, Kuppers, M, Martinez-Jimenez, M, Lloro, I, Sort, J, (2017).

This effort generated NASA''''s first grand challenge, the Asteroid Grand Challenge (AGC), a large-scale effort using multidisciplinary collaborations and innovative engagement mechanisms, that focused on finding and addressing asteroid threats to human populations. In April 2010, President Barack Obama announced a mission to send humans to an asteroid by 2025. This resulted in the agency''''s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to leverage and maximize existing robotic and human efforts to capture and reroute an asteroid, with the goal of eventual human exploration. The AGC, initiated in 2013, complemented ARM by expanding public participation, partnerships, and other approaches to find, understand, and overcome these potentially harmful asteroids. This article describes a selection of AGC activities implemented from 2013 to 2017 and their results, excluding those conducted by NASA''''s Near-Earth Object Observations Program and other organizations. The strategic development of the initiative is outlined as well as initial successes, strengths, and weaknesses resulting from the first 4 years of AGC activities and approaches. Finally, we describe lesson learned and areas for continued work and study. The AGC lessons learned and strategies could inform the work of other agencies and organizations seeking to conduct a global scientific investigation with matrixed organizational support, multiple strategic partners, and numerous internal and external open innovation approaches and audiences.

These new class of space systems exploit the latest advances and miniaturization of electronics, computer hardware, sensors, power systems and communication technologies to promise reduced launch-cost and development cadence. These small-satellites offer the best option yet to explore some of the 17,000 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) and nearly 740,000 Main-Belt asteroids found. The exploration of these asteroids can give us insight into the formation of the solar-system, planetary defense and future prospect for space mining. Recent examples of asteroid/small-body missions target asteroids that are 100s of meters in length. Most of these discovered asteroids arc lOs of meters in length and hence having the technology to explore them will open a new frontier in solar system exploration. However, these very small asteroids lack an accurate ephemeris and with current limitations in NASA''''s Deep Space Network (DSN) communication and tracking system, there is a 2-5 km uncertainty in distance between a spacecraft and a target. Some of these small-bodies are carbon-rich and have low-albedos that make them hard to find. However, it is these carbon-rich asteroids that are prime targets for solar-system origin studies and for asteroid mining Overall, this presents a major navigations challenge. In this work, we develop a solution to the problem at hand. This encompasses integration of the right navigational instruments, detectors, attitude determination and control system, together with propulsion and software control system to autonomously search and ''''home-in'''' on the target body. Our navigation approach utilizes an outward spiraling ''''diamond maneuver''''. The spacecraft spirals outwards if the small-body is not found in the volume enclosed. Once a small-body is found, the spacecraft performs gradient descent using its imagers to close-in on the small-body. In worst-case scenarios, visual techniques to detect occlusion or thermal imagery will be used to identify the target. Once found, the spacecraft performs a helical flyby maneuver to map the asteroid. The results point towards a promising pathway for further development and testing of our navigation technology aboard a demonstrator CubeSat.",22,,2018,,,,Engineering,"Schwartz, S, Nallapu, RT, Gankidi, P, Dektor, G, Thangavelautham, J, (2018).

While nearly all NEOs of diameter > 1 km, capable of causing a global climatic disaster, have been discovered and have negligible chance of impacting in the near future, we are far from completion in our effort to detect and characterize smaller objects. In an effort to test our preparedness to respond to a potential NEO impact threat, we conducted a community-led global planetary defense exercise with support from the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The target of our exercise was 2012 TC4, the similar to 10 m diameter asteroid that made a close pass by the Earth on 2017 October 12 at a distance of about 50,000 km. The goal of the TC4 observing campaign was to recover, track, and characterize 2012 TC4 as a hypothetical impactor in order to exercise the global planetary defense system involving observations, modeling, prediction, and communication. We made three attempts with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on 2017 July 27, 31 and on 2017 August 5 and recovered 2012 TC4 within its ephemeris uncertainty at 2.2 arcmin from the nominal prediction. At visual magnitude V = 27, the recovery of 2012 TC4 is the faintest NEA detection thus far. If an impact during the 2017 close approach had been possible based on the 2012 astrometric data, these recovery observations would have been sufficient to confirm or rule out the impact. The first automatic detection by a survey (Pan-STARRS1) was on September 25, which is the earliest that 2012 TC4 would have been discovered in survey mode, if it had not been discovered in 2012. We characterized 2012 TC4 using photometry, spectroscopy and radar techniques. Based on photometric observations, we determined a rotation period of 12.2 min with an amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes. An additional lower amplitude period was detected, indicating that 2012 TC4 was in a state of non-principal axis rotation. The combined visible and near-infrared spectrum puts it in the taxonomic X-class. Radar images at 1.875 m resolution placed only a few range pixels on the asteroid, reveal an angular, asymmetric, and elongated shape, and establish that 2012 TC4 is less than 20 m on its long axis. We estimate a circular polarization ratio of 0.57 + -0.08 that is relatively high among NEAs observed to date by radar. We also performed a probabilistic impact risk assessment exercise for hypothetical impactors based on the 2012 TC4 observing campaign. This exercise was performed as part of ongoing efforts to advance effective impact risk models and assessment processes for planetary defense. The 2012 TC4 close approach provided a valuable opportunity to test the application of these methods using realistically evolving observational data to define the modeling inputs. To this end, risk assessments were calculated at several epochs before and during the close approach, incorporating new information about 2012 TC4 as it became available. Two size ranges were assessed-one smaller size range (H = 26.7) similar to the actual 2012 TC4, and one larger size range (H = 21.9) to produce a greater-damage scenario for risk assessment. Across the epochs, we found that only irons caused significant damage for smaller size. For the larger size case, however, hydrous stones caused the greatest damage, anhydrous stones caused the least damage, and irons caused moderate damage. We note that the extent of damage depends on composition in different size regimes and, after astrometry, size is the most important physical property to determine for an incoming object.",49,7,2019,10.1016/j.icarus.2019.02.018,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.02.018,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Reddy, V, Kelley, MS, Farnocchia, D, Ryan, WH, Thomas, CA, Benner, LAM, Dotson, J, Micheli, M, Brucker, MJ, Bus, SJ, Brozovic, M, Wheeler, L, Abbasi, V, Bauer, JM, Bonsall, A, Brown, Z, Busch, MW, Chodas, P, Choi, YJ, Erasmus, N, Fast, KE, Faucher, JP, Ferdes, R, Ghigo, FD, Gilbank, DG, Giorgini, JD, Gustafsson, A, Hainaut, O, Harris, WM, Jao, JS, Johnson, LS, Kareta, T, Kim, MJ, Koschny, D, Kramer, EA, Landis, RR, Laurin, DG, Larsen, JA, Lee, CG, Lejoly, C, Lister, T, McMillan, R, Masiero, JR, Mathias, D, Mommert, M, Moon, HK, Moskovitz, NA, Naidu, SP, Nallapu, RT, Niazi, HK, Noo, J, Polishook, D, Ryan, EV, Schatz, L, Scotti, JV, Sharkey, B, Shustov, BM, Sickafoose, AA, Silva, MA, Slade, MA, Slick, L, Snedeker, LG, Springmann, A, Tholen, D, Trilling, DE, Vodniza, AQ, Wainscoat, R, Weryk, R, Yoshikawa, M, (2019).

A debate is ongoing in the scientific community as to how best to divert such a threat. In 2005 NASA was directed by Congress to provide a report on the detection of near-Earth objects (NEOs) and their mitigation if determined to be a threat. The report was delivered in March 2007; as input to that report, the work reported here provided information on conventional methods to divert a potentially hazardous object (PHO) including conventional explosives and direct impact with a rocket. Other slow push conventional approaches include propulsion systems attached to the asteroid or comet and the recently proposed gravitational tractor. Advantages of conventional explosives are that they can be delivered in small packages so that the asteroid or comet is in no danger of being broken up and it is possible to accurately compute the momentum transferred to the asteroid or comet through modern validated numerical techniques. This work demonstrates that conventional explosives can be an efficient conventional method to divert an asteroid or comet and computes the amounts of explosives needed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Several NEO hazard studies conducted over the past few years provide forecasts, impact probabilities and assessment ratings, such as the Torino and Palermo scales. These high-risk NEO assessments involve several criteria, including impact energy, mass, and absolute magnitude. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to classify hazardous NEOs. Our approach applies a combination of two methods from a widely utilized decision making theory. Specifically, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology is employed to determine the criteria weights, which influence the decision making, and the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to obtain a ranking of alternatives (potentially hazardous NEOs). In addition, NEO datasets provided by the NASA Near-Earth Object Program are utilized.

The study presented here evaluates available protection strategies to identify bottlenecks limiting the scale of near-Earth object that could be deflected, using cutting-edge and near-future technologies. It discusses the use of a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) as a propulsion device for delivery of thermonuclear payloads to deflect or destroy a long-period comet on a collision course with Earth. A ''''worst plausible scenario'''' for the available warning time (10 months) and comet approach trajectory are determined, and empirical data are used to make an estimate of the payload necessary to deflect such a comet. Optimizing the tradeoff between early interception and large deflection payload establishes the ideal trajectory for an interception mission to follow. The study also examines the potential for multiple rocket launch dates. Comparison of propulsion technologies for this mission shows that NTR outperforms other options substantially. The discussion concludes with an estimate of the comet size (5 km) that could be deflected using NTR propulsion, given current launch capabilities.",24,2,2011,10.1243/09544100JAERO753,,http://doi.org/10.1243/09544100JAERO753,Engineering,"Zhang, XL, Ball, E, Granier, C, Kochmanski, L, Howe, SD, (2011).

Combining these new capabilities with that of a high-precision orbit propagator, this paper describes fictional mission trajectory design examples of using AMiDST as applied to a fictitious asteroid 2013 PDC-E. During the 2013 IAA Planetary Defense Conference, the asteroid 2013 PDC-E was used for an exercise where participants simulated the decision-making process for developing deflection and civil defense responses to a hypothetical asteroid threat.

NASA and the Department of Energy (DOE)''''s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) have partnered to develop a full systems framework for understanding very short warning time scenarios requiring high-energy impulsive solutions to neutralize Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs) found to be on Earth-impacting trajectories. While previous studies have identified and studied certain aspects of the end-to-end impactor mitigation problem in some detail, the preliminary results for year one of a 3-year research investigation we report on herein will discuss the development of an integrated framework extensible to future data and emergent near-Earth object (NEO) mitigation strategies. As we will discuss, recent increases in computational power and algorithm sophistication now allow new calculations of the response of even irregularly shaped/structured NEOs to various proposed mitigation schemes.

The key elements of the study were a high-fidelity detection model and the presence of false detections in the form of both statistical noise and difference image artifacts. We employed the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) to generate tracklets, tracks, and orbits with a realistic detection density for one month of the LSST survey. The main goals of the study were to understand whether (a) the linking of near-Earth objects (NEOs) into orbits can succeed in a realistic survey, (b) the number of false tracks and orbits will be manageable, and (c) the accuracy of linked orbits would be sufficient for automated processing of discoveries and attributions. We found that the overall density of asteroids was more than 5000 per LSST field near opposition on the ecliptic, plus up to 3000 false detections per field in good seeing. We achieved 93.6% NEO linking efficiency for H < 22 on tracks composed of tracklets from at least three distinct nights within a 12 day interval. The derived NEO catalog was comprised of 96% correct linkages. Less than 0.1% of orbits included false detections, and the remainder of false linkages stemmed from main belt confusion, which was an artifact of the short time span of the simulation. The MOPS linking efficiency can be improved by refined attribution of detections to known objects and by improved tuning of the internal kd-tree linking algorithms.",18,7,2017,10.3847/1538-3881/aa73d0,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aa73d0,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Veres, P, and Chesley, SR, (2017).

This crater probability distribution indicates, that the largest craters on both the Earth and the Moon are dominated by comets. However, from a calculation of the fractional probabilities of iridium deposition, and the velocity distributions at impact of each NEO population, the only realistic possibilities, for the Chicxulub impactor are a short-period comet (possibly inactive) or a near-Earth asteroid.

Mitigation of a clear and present near-Earth object (NEO) threat to the Earth must provide the greatest assurance of success with the least risk to the planet. In some cases, mining a threatening NEO may become a viable alternative or supplement to a deflection or interception scenario. This converts the NEO threat to a near-Earth resource. NEOs can supply materials for a wide range of operations both in space and on Earth, as they are thought to contain large amounts of water, carbon, structural metals, industrial feedstocks of many types, and precious metals. This wealth has low overhead for utilization in space; some known NEOs would require lower transportation energy expenditure than lunar resources. Mining a NEO inherently requires, among other things, altering the mass distribution of the body during exposure, removal, and processing of the ore. These processes can be tailored to facilitate deflection of the body from Earth impact by altering its orbital characteristics. The advantage of NEO mining is that it can mitigate the threat - the primary effort - while converting it into resources for space exploration. This additional effort, within an appropriate time scale, allows sequential mitigation of the NEO in a controlled manner while providing the resources contained within the NEO for use either in space or on Earth. Both goals, to be successful, will require maximum utilization of all sources of knowledge. The two most important are an extensive reconnaissance of the target NEO and the long history of terrestrial mining practice. This paper discusses how current mining technology might be adapted to mine NEOs, whether threatening or not. It summarizes our knowledge of NEO composition, physical properties, and mining and processing methods, and points out areas where further research, especially physical testing in space, is vital. The great potential of NEO resources and the successful mitigation of NEO threats will be best realized if their utilization is considered from the earliest planning of Earth-NEO mitigations.",59,,1997,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48361.x,,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb48361.x,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Gertsch, R, Remo, JL, Gertsch, LS, (1997).

Comets undergo resurfacing due to solar radiation, while their primordial interiors remain unchanged. Multi-epoch observations of comets enable us to characterize a change in sublimation pattern as a function of heliocentric distance, which in turn provides information on the dust environments of comets. Aims. We aim to constrain the size and porosity of ejected dust particles from comet 252P/LINEAR and their evolution near perihelion via near-infrared (NIR) multiband polarimetry. A close approach of the comet to the Earth in March 2016 (similar to 0.036 au) provided a rare opportunity for the sampling of the comet at high spatial resolution. Methods. We made NIR JHK(S)-band (1.25-2.25 mu m) polarimetric observations of the comet for 12 days near perihelion, interspersed between broadband optical (0.48-0.80 mu m) imaging observations over four months. In addition, a dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward in time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements of 252P/LINEAR. Before the first enhancement, the NIR polarization degrees of the comet were far lower than those of ordinary comets at a given phase angle. Soon after the activation, however, they increased by similar to 13% at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric color over the J and H bands (-2.55% mu m(-1) on average) and bluing of the dust color in both J-H and H-K-S. Throughout the event, the polarization vector was marginally aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane (i.e., theta(r) = 4.6 degrees-10.9 degrees). The subsequent postperihelion reactivation of the comet lasted for approximately 1.5 months, with a factor of similar to 30 times pre-activation dust mass-loss rates in the R-C band. Conclusions. The marked increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is reminiscent of the behavior of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The most plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric properties of 252P/LINEAR is an ejection of predominantly large (well within the geometrical optics regime) and compact dust particles from the desiccated surface layer. We conjecture that the more intense solar heating that the comet has received in the near-Earth orbit would cause the paucity of small fluffy dust particles around the nucleus of the comet.",97,9,2019,10.1051/0004-6361/201935542,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201935542,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Kwon, YG, Ishiguro, M, Kwon, J, Kuroda, D, Im, M, Choi, C, Tamura, M, Nagayama, T, Kawai, N, Watanabe, JI, (2019).

However, physical characterization of these objects is restricted to their surface properties. For the purpose of mitigation (i.e., to nudge a potentially hazardous object out of its orbit), it is necessary to determine the bulk properties of NEOs, such as material strengths, composition, structure, and moments of inertia. We discuss some of the needs and suggest several experiments to fulfill these requirements. We also urge that NASA, ESA, and other space agencies establish Support Offices for Microgravity Research for Small Solar System Bodies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

All of the spectra will be collected using a slitless ultraviolet spectrometer in Earth orbit. Analysis of these spectra will reveal the degree of chemical diversity in the meteors, as observed in a single meteor shower. Such meteors are traceable to a specific parent body and we know exactly when the meteoroids in a particular shower were released from that parent body (Asher, in: Arlt (ed.) Proc. International Meteor Conference, 2000; Lyytinen and van Flandern, Earth Moon Planets 82-83:149-166, 2000). By observing multiple apparitions of meteor showers we can therefore obtain quasi-stratigraphic information on an individual comet or asteroid. We might also be able to measure systematic effects of chemical weathering in meteoroids from specific parent bodies by looking for correlations in the depletions of the more volatile elements as a function of space exposure (Borovicka et al., Icarus 174:15-30, 2005). By observing the relation between meteor entry characteristics (such as the rate of deceleration or breakup) and chemistry we can determine if our meteorite collection is deficient in the most volatile-rich samples. Finally, we can obtain a direct measurement of metal deposition into the terrestrial stratosphere that may act to catalyze atmospheric chemical reactions.",38,6,2008,10.1007/s11038-007-9178-y,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s11038-007-9178-y,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geology,"Nuth, JA, Lowrance, JL, and Carruthers, GR, (2008).

Given the present uncertainty in the geometry, topography and materials properties of the asteroids and/or comets, a deflection mechanism is required which is relatively insensitive to such details. Stand-off nuclear devices present an option to fulfill this criterion. Momentum can be transferred by several mechanisms: directly by means of the kinetic energy of the debris or, more efficiently, by ablation resulting from the absorption of X-rays. Thermonuclear devices additionally produce high energy neutrons. Using approximate models of the various types of NEO materials and tabulations from the literature, we construct effective X-ray and neutron mass absorption coefficients. The latter are incorporated into a simple model to calculate the impulse, and hence the velocity change imparted by the various nuclear products to all the NEO materials models.",42,9,1995,10.1016/0094-5765(95)00111-5,,http://doi.org/10.1016/0094-5765(95)00111-5,Engineering,"Hammerling, P, Remo, JL, (1995).

The ability to search at closer elongations from the sun and being able to observe continuously, allowing quick revisits of new asteroids, are some of the unique benefits of a space platform. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) together with Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) are planning a micro-satellite platform with a 15 cm telescope dedicated for near space surveillance. The NEOSSat (Near Earth Object Surveillance) spacecraft is expected to be able to detect 20 v magnitude objects with a 100 see exposure, with a 0.85 deg FOV, on a 1024 x 1024 CCD, and sub arcsec pointing stability. For detection of NEO small bodies, it will be able to search an area from 45 degrees solar elongation and approximately 40 degrees north to south degrees in elevation. The observation strategy will be optimized to find as many asteroids as possible, based on recent models of asteroid population. Ground based telescopes will also be used to complement follow-ups for orbit determination when possible. The microsatellite is based on the CSA very successful MOST micro-satellite, operating since 2003. Baselined for launch in 2010, the NEOSSat is a shared project with DRDC to demonstrate the technology of an inexpensive space platform to detect High Earth Orbit (HEOSS) earth-orbiting satellites and debris.",20,,2008,10.1117/12.789736,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.789736,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics,"Laurin, D, Hildebrand, A, Cardinal, R, Harvey, W, and Tafazoli, S, (2008).

In addition to customary technical sessions, we performed the first week-long threat exercise designed to simulate and examine the process of decision making that would accompany the discovery and response to an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. Our role in the exercise was to develop and present a plausible scenario that would be of interest to as many participants as possible while considering the broad diversity in technical expertise, approach, values, missions, and national affiliations of the conference attendees. Moreover, we strove to present a reasonable sequence of events spanning several years that would provide many opportunities for collective decision making under uncertainty by parties likely to have conflicting interests. In order to hold the attention of the participants throughout the week we tried to create a scenario that would be as dramatic as possible-including ''cliffhangers''' and unexpected turns of events-but without sacrificing realism. This allowed us to discuss a wide range of potential responses""",22,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Boslough, M, Chodas, P, Ezzedine, S, Jennings, B, Fogleman, B, (2016).

In this same time frame, Congress set the goal of cataloguing 90% of all NEOs down to 140 meters diameter by 2020. The SDT concluded that the infrared passband from similar to 5 to similar to 11 microns is the best for finding NEOs; that an aperture of 50 centimeters is sufficient; and that locating a NEO-finding observatory in a Venus-like orbit is ideal. Since then, NASA and its industrial partners (such as Ball Aerospace) have flown two very NEO-relevant deep-space missions the Spitzer Space Telescope and Kepler. Herein, a high-reliability, credibly-costed design is presented based on Spitzer and Kepler that meets the 90%/140-m/2020 requirements for about $600M. This design will also detect about 85% of all >100 meter NEOs, about 70% of all >65 meter NEOs, and about 50% of all >50 meter NEOs. These smaller NEOs constitute a newly recognized threat regime that cannot be efficiently found from the ground.",5,,2010,10.1063/1.3326270,,http://doi.org/10.1063/1.3326270,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Energy & Fuels; Physics,"Arentz, R, Reitsema, H, Van Cleve, J, Linfield, R, (2010).

NEOWISE collects simultaneous observations at 3.4 and 4.6. mu m of solar system objects passing through its field of regard. These data allow for the determination of total thermal emission from bodies in the inner solar system, and thus the sizes of these objects.

We compare our results with previous thermal model results from NEOWISE for overlapping sample sets, as well as diameters determined through other independent methods, and find that our diameter measurements for NEOs agree to within 26% (1 sigma) of previously measured values.

NEOs offer insight into both the origins of the Solar System and of life, as well as a source of materials for future missions. With NEOview scientists can locate NEO datasets, explore metadata provided by the archives, and query or combine disparate NEO datasets in the search for NEO candidates for exploration. NEOview is a software system that illustrates how standards-based interfaces facilitate NEO data discovery and research. NEOview software follows a client-server architecture. The server is a configurable implementation of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Table Access Protocol (TAP), a general interface for tabular data access, that can be deployed as a front end to existing NEO datasets. The TAP client, seleste, is a graphical interface that provides intuitive means of discovering NEO providers, exploring dataset metadata to identify fields of interest, and constructing queries to retrieve or combine data. It features a powerful, graphical query builder capable of easing the user''''s introduction to table searches. Through science use cases, NEOview demonstrates how potential targets for NEO rendezvous could be identified by combining data from complementary sources. Through deployment and operations, it has been shown that the software components are data independent and configurable to many different data servers. As such, NEOview''''s TAP server and seleste TAP client can be used to create a seamless environment for data discovery and exploration for tabular data in any astronomical archive.",2,,2013,,,,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Computer Science,"Tibbetts, M, Elvis, M, Galache, JL, Harbo, P, McDowell, JC, Rudenko, M, Van Stone, D, Zografou, P, (2013).

The NEOWISE survey detected NEOs the same way whether they were previously known or not, subject to the availability of ground-based follow-up observations, resulting in the discovery of more than 130 new NEOs. The survey''''s uniform sensitivity, observing cadence, and image quality have permitted extrapolation of the 428 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detected by NEOWISE during the fully cryogenic portion of the WISE mission to the larger population. We find that there are 981 +/- 19 NEAs larger than 1 km and 20,500 +/- 3000 NEAs larger than 100 m. We show that the Spaceguard goal of detecting 90% of all 1 km NEAs has been met, and that the cumulative size distribution is best represented by a broken power law with a slope of 1.32 +/- 0.14 below 1.5 km. This power-law slope produces similar to 13,200 +/- 1900 NEAs with D > 140 m. Although previous studies predict another break in the cumulative size distribution below D similar to 50-100 m, resulting in an increase in the number of NEOs in this size range and smaller, we did not detect enough objects to comment on this increase. The overall number for the NEA population between 100 and 1000 m is lower than previous estimates. The numbers of near-Earth comets and potentially hazardous NEOs will be the subject of future work.",67,12,2011,10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/156,,http://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/156,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Mainzer, A, Grav, T, Bauer, J, Masiero, J, McMillan, RS, Cutri, RM, Walker, R, Wright, E, Eisenhardt, P, Tholen, DJ, Spahr, T, Jedicke, R, Denneau, L, DeBaun, E, Elsbury, D, Gautier, T, Gomillion, S, Hand, E, Mo, W, Watkins, J, Wilkins, A, Bryngelson, GL, Molina, AD, Desai, S, Camus, MG, Hidalgo, SL, Konstantopoulos, I, Larsen, JA, Maleszewski, C, Malkan, MA, Mauduit, JC, Mullan, BL, Olszewski, EW, Pforr, J, Saro, A, Scotti, JV, Wasserman, LH, (2011).

It is a further development of some previous studies already submitted to ESA (Sysiphos, Spaceguard-1). The general concept is that a small satellite equipped with both a detector for visible wavelengths and an array for thermal IR measurements around 10 pm would be an ideal platform to obtain simultaneously two of the major objectives of current NEO science, namely the physical characterization of the objects and the discovery of those NEOs that are difficult to detect from the ground because their orbits are entirely or partly inside the Earth''''s orbit. The NERO study includes a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of different orbital options for the satellite (including L2 of Earth and L2 of Venus) and a preliminary simulation of the effectiveness of orbit determination based oil NERO observations of newly detected objects.

CCD equipped cameras have revolutionized astronomy and space-related optical telescope measurements in recent years. They are also used in electroscopic measurements, e.g., in fields such as geology, biology, and medicine. The signal-to-noise ratio and the probability of detection are crucial to design experiments observation setups properly and to employ further mathematical methods for data exploitation such as, e.g. multi-target tracking methods. Previous attempts to correctly characterize the signal-to-noise ratio for star observations are revisited in this work and adapted for the application of near-Earth object observations and high precision measurements, leading to a modified CCD equation. Our formulation proposes a novel distribution of the signal noise that accurately accounts for the truncation noise and the presence of ambiguous pixels. These improvements are employed to derive the probability of detection and the SNR with significant improvements compared to existing formulations when ambiguous pixels are present. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

Preliminary results of a fragmented NEO dispersion scenario emphasize global parameter search methods for use in engineering mission analysis. A model of the NEO fragmentation process is presented for a subsurface nuclear explosion and penetrating contact burst. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation to establish a mean response of the target NEO to the fragmentation process. Resulting coherent masses are propagated through a model of solar system dynamics until the predetermined date of impact. On some orbits, the impacting mass can be reduced to lower than 0.1% of the NEO mass. (C) 2012 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Deflection or disruption of a potentially hazardous object could prevent future Earth impacts, but due to our limited ability to perform experiments directly on asteroids, our understanding of the process relies upon large -scale hydrodynamic simulations. Related simulations must be vetted through code validation by benchmarking against relevant laboratory -scale, hypervelocity -impact experiments. To this end, we compare simulation results from Spheral, an adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, to the fragment -mass and velocity data from the 1991 two -stage light gas -gun impact experiment on a basalt sphere target, conducted at Kyoto University by Nakamura and Fujiwara. We find that the simulations are sensitive to the selected strain models, strength models, and material parameters. We find that, by using appropriate choices for these models in conjunction with well -constrained material parameters, the simulations closely resemble with the experimental results. Numerical codes implementing these model and parameter selections may provide new insight into the formation of asteroid families (Michel et al., 2015,",,2,2020,https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EA000474,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018EA000474,Earth and Space Science,"Remington, T.P., Owen, J.M., Nakamura, A.M., Miller, P.L. and Bruck Syal, M., 2020.

For the artificial satellites optical observations should be addressed in order to corroborate telemetry and other observational techniques. An increasing importance is addressed to space debris, which are tremendously increased into the last decade. Their orbital evolution is very sensitive to gravitational harmonics of the Earth, tidal effects of the Moon, Sun and major planets, and to non-gravitational forces. Observational survey is required during their evolution on the orbit but also during their falls through the atmosphere.

The obtained data will be used to study various fields of astronomy, such as formation and evolution of galaxies, star formation, interstellar matter, brown dwarf, and dark matter. In addition to these, ASTRO-F also observes objects in the solar system, such as asteroids, comets, and interplanetary dust. In this paper, we investigated the possible observation for Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), especially Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), by ASTRO-F. The definition of NEA is the asteroids whose perihelion distance is less than 1.3 AU. At the beginning of 2002, there were about 1750 NEAs. Among these NEAs, about 250 are numbered asteroids and about 1500 are unnumbered ones. At first we studied the number of NEAs that ASTRO-F can observe during the first survey period of six months in 2004. The result is that 140 NEAs (48 numbered and 92 unnumbered asteroids) will be observed if we assume that the limiting magnitude of the observation is 20 in V band. Next we checked infrared observations in the past for these 140 NEAs and found that most of them do not have infrared data. ASTRO-F has a capability to observe at 1.8-5, 5-12, 10-26, and 50-200 mum. Using these data, we can obtain the albedo and the size of these NEAs. We think that these data will be useful not only in the scientific researches but also in the hazard analysis of asteroid collision. (C) 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

On the base of obtained radio images of the asteroid, the value of an albedo has estimated as p=0.06. Coming from the albedo value and the comet-like orbit, it was suggested, that the object is a dead comet. In order to verify the supposition, the orbital evolution of 2015TB145 was investigated under the perturbing action of major planets for the time interval of 50 kyrs. As a result, it was found that one cycle of variations of the argument of perihelion is equal to nearly 40 kyrs and during this period the object intersects the Earth''''s orbit eight times, i.e. it is the octuple crosser. Consequently, if the object has a cometary origin, then it can be associated with a meteoroid stream producing eight meteor showers which should be observable on the Earth. Features of the predicted meteor showers, theoretically associated with 2015TB145, were calculated and a search for observable showers identical to predicted ones was realized using all published catalogues. It turned out, that seven of eight predicted showers were identified with the active observable meteor showers. So, comet-like orbit, low value of an albedo and association with the meteoroid stream producing identified showers are strong evidences pointing that 2015TB145 is really inactive comet. A conclusion was made that the potentially hazardous object 2015TB145 is very likely extinct nucleus of a parent comet of the found meteoroid stream.",30,9,2017,10.1016/j.pss.2016.10.014,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2016.10.014,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Kokhirova, GI, Babadzhanov, PB, Khamroev, UH, (2017).

The method is based on the use of fractional, one-half order derivative of a Doppler signal. The algorithm suggested is much simpler and more economical than the classical one, and it appears preferable for use in orbital weapon systems of threat response. Application of fractional differentiation to quick evaluation of mean frequency location of the reflected Doppler signal is justified. The method allows an assessment of the mean frequency in the time domain without spectral analysis. An algorithm structure for the real-time estimation is presented. The velocity resolution estimates are made for typical asteroids in the X-band.

Potentially Hazardous Objects are responsible for a number of catastrophic events that have taken place during the history of our planet. The question of whether our society has a sufficiently developed technology level to deflect one of these objects is a question that has no easy answer. Many concepts have been proposed for deflecting hazardous asteroids, ranging from the exploitation of the Yarkovsky effect, to attaching ion engines to the asteroid to push it far enough from the Earth, to impacting the asteroid at hypervelocity with a large enough mass. In order to assess the feasibility of all these possibilities, a simple way of evaluating the asteroid miss-distance after some velocity has been transferred to the asteroid itself is greatly beneficial. In this paper, a suitable mathematical expression is derived and discussed. The expression is found in the framework of simple two-body dynamics and accounts for the eccentricity of the asteroid orbit as well as for a generic deflection strategy. A comparison with a fill numerical simulation of the asteroid deflection mechanism reveals that the formula has a high degree of accuracy for a wide range of asteroid orbits and acceleration values.",4,,2005,,,,Engineering,"Izzo, D, (2005).

At that time its data-arc span was only 24 d; now it is 2947 d. Here we revisit the topic of the dynamical status of this remarkable object as well as look into its dynamical past and explore its future orbital evolution which is driven by close encounters with both the Earth-Moon system and Mercury. In our calculations, we use a Hermite integration scheme, the most updated ephemerides and include the perturbations by the eight major planets, the Moon and the three largest asteroids. We confirm that 2002 VE68 currently is a quasi-satellite of Venus, and it has remained as such for at least 7000 yr after a close fly-by with the Earth. Prior to that encounter the object may have already been co-orbital with Venus or moving in a classical, non-resonant near-Earth object (NEO) orbit. The object drifted into the quasi-satellite phase from an L-4 Trojan state. We also confirm that, at aphelion, dangerously close encounters with the Earth (under 0.002 au, well inside the Hill sphere) are possible. We find that 2002 VE68 will remain as a quasi-satellite of Venus for about 500 yr more and its dynamical evolution is controlled not only by the Earth, with a non-negligible contribution from the Moon, but by Mercury as well. 2002 VE68 exhibits resonant (or near-resonant) behaviour with Mercury, Venus and the Earth.

The sequential transfer trajectory is designed by solving two Lambert''''s problems that yield a chain collision between a spacecraft and an intermediate asteroid, followed by a collision between the intermediate asteroid and an NEA. The characteristics of the low-cost trajectories are then identified with respect to the optimal collision point. We show that the feasibility of the mission depends on the existence of an intermediate asteroid with small minimum orbit interception distance (MOID) with the NEA. Moreover the selection strategy of an intermediate asteroid that makes the mission feasible is discussed.

The simulation incorporates realistic pointing and phase errors. Pointing error components include systematic offsets to simulate manufacturing and assembly variations. Pointing also includes time-varying errors that simulate structural vibrations, informed from random vibration analysis of the mechanical design. Phase errors include systematic offsets, and time-varying errors due to both mechanical vibration and temperature variation in the fibers. The optical simulation is used to determine beam pattern and pointing jitter over a range of composite error inputs. Results are also presented for a 1 m aperture array with 10 kW total power, designed as a stand-off system on a dedicated asteroid diversion/capture mission that seeks to evaporate the surface of the target at a distance of beyond 10 km.

To this purpose, a recent model of the laser ablation mechanism based on the characteristics of both the laser systems and the asteroid has been used to calculate the exerted thrust in terms of direction and magnitude. This paper shows a preliminary deflection uncertainty analysis for two different control logic and assuming different laser mechanism capabilities. In particular, an optimal thrust control direction and fixed laser pointing strategies were considered with two laser optics settings: the first maintaining the focus length fixed and the second able to exactly focus on the surface. Preliminary results show that in general the fixed laser pointing strategy at low power is less able to impart high deflection. Nonetheless, when the power increases, the optimal thrust method produces undesired torques, which reduces the laser momentum coupling as side effects. However, the overall efficiency is higher in the optimal thrust case. Since the collision risk between an impacting asteroid and the Earth depends on the probability distribution of the input uncertainty parameters, it is necessary to study how the overall deflection will be affected. Both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties are taken into account to evaluate the probability of success of the proposed deflection methods.",18,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Vetrisano, M, Cano, JL, Thiry, N, Tardioli, C, Vasile, M, (2016).

New ideas and concepts are continually proposed to mitigate possible impact. Among them, the gravity tractor is promising and has been the focus of many recent studies on asteroid deflection. The gravity-tractor concept is studied and trajectories are designed to lessen the risk of impact of a near-Earth object. By means of a mathematical model of the gravity tractor, a high-fidelity trajectory design method for deflection is proposed. The optimal deflection of an asteroid is computed by an indirect method, and the trajectory of the spacecraft is deduced by an inversion of dynamics and optimal control. When the deflection achieved is compared with results published to date, the better performance of the deflection is clear. This paper shows that current literature analyses of the gravity-tractor design may be nonoptimal because the assumption made about the control penalizes the concept. The use of optimal control actually improves the robustness of the designed trajectory while obtaining higher deflection.",25,5,2010,10.2514/1.46378,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.46378,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,"Olympio, JT, (2010).

From an application of both methods to a fictitious NEO we find Catusi''''s parallel approach to be reasonable for phases of unperturbed two-body motion. But, for orbit phases inhering third-body perturbations, i.e., for planetary close approaches or prior to a collision, the results obtained from the new method show the radial component of deflection impulse to play a major role. We show that a fivefold greater efficiency can be achieved by a deflection impulse being non-parallel to orbital velocity. The new method is applied to two possible 99942 Apophis impact trajectories in order to provide constraints for future Apophis deflection mission analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Little work has been done so far to assess the atmospheric perturbation from the impact of objects in this size range, even though their sizes are close to the threshold for causing global environmental effects. In particular, at the Earth''s surface oceanic impacts are twice more likely to occur than land impacts. This work represents the first attempt at combining impact simulations with a three-dimensional shock physics code (SOVA), and atmospheric simulations using the general circulation model with interactive chemistry WACCM. SOVA simulations provided an estimate of the amount and state of material ejected into the atmosphere by the impacts. Estimated water vapor in the upper atmosphere was then introduced in the initial conditions for the WACCM simulations that modeled the subsequent perturbation of atmospheric chemistry Final estimates of the change over time in UV flux at the surface due to the impact-induced ozone change are then carried out using the TUV radiative transfer model. The results suggest that mid-latitude oceanic impacts of 1 km asteroids can produce a significant, global perturbation of upper atmospheric chemistry, including multi-year global ozone depletion comparable to ozone hole records registered in the mid-1990 s. Asteroids 500 m in diameter cause limited perturbations of upper atmospheric chemistry with significant ozone depletion confined to the hemisphere in which the impact occurred. Impact-induced ozone depletion affects UV irradiance at the Earth''s surface, resulting in levels of UV-B irradiance that can be dangerous for living organisms, and, in the tropics and initial midlatitude summers, far exceed levels currently experienced anywhere on Earth.

This code was both copyrighted and patented to avoid unauthorized use of ideas that could possibly be vital to construct a planetary defense system in the vicinity of the Earth. Having so said, the basic ideas and equations underlying the ASTEROFF simulation code are openly described in this paper. A system of two space bases housing missiles is proposed to achieve the planetary defense of the Earth against dangerous asteroids and comets, collectively called impactors herein. We show that the layout of the Earth-Moon system with the five relevant Lagrangian (or libration) points in space leads naturally to only one, unmistakable location of these two space bases within the sphere of influence of the Earth. These locations are at the two Lagrangian points L-1 (between the Earth and the Moon) and L-3 (in the direction opposite to the Moon from the Earth). We show that placing missile bases at L-1 and L-3 would enable those missiles to deflect the trajectory of impactors by hitting them orthogonally to their impact trajectory toward the Earth, so as to maximize their deflection. We show that confocal conics are the best class of trajectories fulfilling this orthogonal deflection requirement. One additional remark is that the theory developed in this paper is just a beginning for a wider set of future research. In fact, we only develop the Keplerian analytical theory for the optimal planetary defense achievable from the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points L-1 and L-3. Much more sophisticated analytical refinements would be needed to: (1) take into account many perturbation forces of all kinds acting on both the impactors and missiles shot from L-1 and L-3; (2) add more (nonoptimal) trajectories of missiles shot from either the Lagrangian points L-4 and L-5 of the Earth-Moon System or from the surface of the Moon itself; and (3) encompass the full range of missiles currently available to the US (and possibly other countries) so as to really see which impactors could be diverted by which missiles, even in the very simplified scheme outlined here. Published for the first time in February 2002, our Keplerian planetary defense theory has proved, in just one year, to be simple enough to catch the attention of scholars, in addition to popular writers, and even of someone from the US Military.

To compute the increase in the minimum orbit intersection distance of the asteroid due to an impact with a spacecraft, simple analytical formulas are derived from proximal motion equations. The proposed analytical formulation allows for an analysis of the optimal direction of the deviating impulse transferred to the asteroid. This ideal optimal direction cannot be achieved for every asteroid at any time; therefore, an analysis of the optimal launch opportunities for deviating a number of selected asteroids was performed through the use of a global optimization procedure. The results in this paper demonstrate that the proximal motion formulation has very good accuracy in predicting the actual deviation and can be used with any deviation method because it has general validity. Furthermore, the characterization of optimal launch opportunities shows that a significant deviation can be obtained even with a small spacecraft.",13,7,2008,10.2514/1.33432,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.33432,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,"Vasile, M, Colombo, C, (2008).

The velocity increment is assumed to have uncertainties of magnitude and direction due to estimation errors of asteroid shape and mass distributions. The uncertainty is modeled using a convex model assuming that magnitude and direction vary independently. The effect of uncertainty is assessed by evaluating the worst (i.e. minimum) value for the closest approach distance between the PHA and Earth. The worst value of the closest approach distance can be determined analytically without searching the whole convex hull. The optimal spacecraft trajectory is designed by maximizing the worst value of the closest approach distance in terms of the Earth departure date and the asteroid arrival date of the spacecraft under C3 (Earth departure energy) constraint. Using a numerical example with a fictitious asteroid, the importance of considering the velocity increment uncertainty is demonstrated by comparing the optimal trajectory with the deterministic optimal trajectory. The uncertainty of the velocity increment direction is shown to have a significant effect on the deflection of the PHA.",13,11,2008,10.2322/tjsass.51.176,,http://doi.org/10.2322/tjsass.51.176,Engineering,"Yamaguchi, T, Kogiso, N, Yamakawa, H, (2008).

If the time to impact is short, or the threatening body too large, nuclear deflection serves as a final option. This work is part of an integrated study by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to better determine the relative efficacy of these complimentary approaches. In particular, we examine the important material properties that affect each approach, to improve critical characterization efforts, and reduce uncertainty in the limits of the impactor technology. Impact speeds for kinetic impactors on Near-Earth Object (NEO) intercept trajectories commonly range from 5 to 20 km/s, resulting in significant crater ejecta and a momentum enhancement above that carried by the impactor. This enhancement depends substantially on the strength and porosity of the asteroid, as well as the impact speed. Here simulations from different codes are presented, along with constraints from experimental measurements. The uncertainties due to ignorance of the strength and porosity of the impact point are significant in determining the limits of impactor sufficiency. The nuclear approach is considered within the context of current capabilities, posing no need to test, as extant and well-understood devices are sufficient for the largest known Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs).

The two realistic responses considered are the use of a spacecraft functioning as either a kinetic impactor or a nuclear explosive carrier to deflect the approaching NEO. The choice depends on the NEO size and mass, the available response time prior to Earth impact, and the various uncertainties. Whenever practical, the kinetic impactor is the preferred approach, but various factors, such as large uncertainties or short available response time, reduce the kinetic impactor''s suitability and, ultimately, eliminate its sufficiency. Herein we examine response time and the activities that occur between the time when an NEO is recognized as being a sufficient threat to require a deflection and the time when the deflection impulse is applied to the NEO. To use a kinetic impactor for successful deflection of an NEO, it is essential to minimize the reaction time and maximize the time available for the impulse delivered to the NEO by the kinetic impactor to integrate forward in time to the eventual deflection of the NEO away from Earth impact. To shorten the response time, we develop tools to survey the profile of needed spacecraft launches and the possible mission payloads. We further present a vehicle design capable of either serving as a kinetic impactor, or, if the need arises, serving as a system to transport a nuclear explosive to the NEO. These results are generated by analyzing a specific case study in which the simulated Earth-impacting NEO is modeled very closely after the real NEO known as 101955 Bennu (1999 RQ(36)).

The DE-STAR system provides thrust by illuminating an Earth-targeting asteroid or comet from afar with a stand-off system consisting of a large phased-array laser in Earth orbit. A much smaller version of the same system called DE-STARLITE travels alongside the target, operating in a stand-on mode, slowly deflecting it over a long period. Such a stand-on system would also permit directing the thrust in any desired direction through careful positioning of the laser relative to the target. This paper presents orbital simulations comparing the effectiveness of both systems across a range of laser and NEO parameters. Simulated parameters include magnitude, duration and, for the stand-on system, direction of the thrust, as well as the type, size and orbital characteristics of the target NEO. These simulations indicate that deflection distance is, in general, proportional to the magnitude of thrust, proportional to the square of the laser on time, and inversely proportional to the mass. Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust direction with optimal direction varying with the object''''s orbital eccentricity. As one example, consider a 325 m asteroid in an orbit of eccentricity e=0.2: given 15 years of warning, a force of just 2 N from a stand-on DE-STARLITE system is sufficient to deflect the asteroid by 2 Earth radii. Numerous scenarios are discussed as is a practical implementation of such a system consistent with current launch vehicle capabilities.",29,,2015,10.1117/12.2186368,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2186368,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,"Zhang, QC, Walsh, KJ, Melis, C, Hughes, GB, Lubin, PM, (2015).

This population is the most likely source of meteorites and consequently, we may expect that some meteorites are from extinct comets in this population. The mineralogy and chemistry of CI and CM chondrites is consistent with the view that they originate from asteroidal objects of carbonaceous spectral classes, and these objects in turn may have a cometary origin. We do not suggest that CI or CM chondrites are directly delivered by active comets during perihelion passage or that these chondrites come from cometary debris in meteor streams.

As of today, our discovery efforts resulted in discovering over 90% of NEOs greater than one kilometer in diameter and none of them has imminent impact threats to the Earth in the foreseeable future. However, the majority of the NEOs with 100-meter diameter or smaller, including potentially hazardous objects, are yet to be discovered. These objects are more frequent impactors and can cause local-scale damage if they impact over a populated area on the Earth although they are statistically more likely to impact over the ocean. In any case, impact hazard warning is important but impossible if we cannot find them. Conventional discovery efforts on the smaller NEOs with telescopes are suffering the following issues. First of all, since these objects are very small, they have to be close enough to the Earth and bright enough to be detected by telescope. Even if they come across the field of view of a telescope at close approaches when their apparent magnitude increases, their images are so faint that they are often buried in noise. This is not only due to their size but also their line-of-sight change rates during the exposure time. Secondly, those who approach from the sun-direction cannot be detected with ground-based telescopes. These issues have driven the planetary defense community to develop new detection techniques and study new survey mission concepts. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is currently studying a new NEO detection mission concept consisting of a cluster of ground-based telescopes and a constellation of space-based telescopes in sun synchronous orbit (SSO). A state-of-art synthetic detection technique based on time delay integration is used to detect the small and fast-moving NEOs. In this work, the mission performance evaluation is conducted in terms the number of NEO discoveries by the mission through one-year observation simulations with the Granvik model-based NEO population, where the number of telescopes and the detectable apparent magnitude limit as a function of line-of-sight change rate are given as design variable. NEO detection capabilities with synthetic and non-synthetic detection approaches are compared. Finally, opportunities for post-detection actions such as followup observations are discussed. The observation simulations resulted in 40 ground-based telescopes could achieve 2,080 detections annually whereas 4 space-based telescopes in SSO could achieve 1,280 detections annually with 20 cm telescopes. The detectability of the NEOs based on the synthetic detection technique could be 3-5 times better than that based on a conventional non-synthetic detection technique. The maximum line-of-sight change rate of the fastest-moving NEO with absolute magnitude 24.1 was 13,865 arcmin/day at the detectable condition. It is also presented that some of the NEOs detected and tracked by the ground part of the proposed mission could be further tracked by follow-up observations of the space part of it, and vice versa.",10,,2018,,,,Engineering,"Sugimoto, Y, Yanagisawa, T, Ikenaga, T, Yoshikawa, M, (2018).

The nature of 3200 Phaethon is still debated because of its asteroidal dynamical behavior as opposed to its connection with the Geminid meteor shower, typical cometary residuals. Owing to its vicinity to our planet (Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance MOID = 0.0206 AU) it has been included also in the class of Potentially Hazardous objects and it has been extensively investigated also during its previous perihelion passages. It has been classified as B-type asteroid (Binzel et al., 2001), with different spectral slopes found by several authors in the wavelength region shortward 0.55 mu m. Many issues remain to be explored regarding the nature of this object and in this context we observed 3200 Phaethon in the course of 24 h during its last closest approach to the Earth. Low-resolution spectra at very high elevation angles (airmass < 1.15) were acquired with the 1.22-m Asiago telescope on 2017-Dec-16 and 2017-Dec-17. The variation of the viewing geometry during these observations was also derived. We found a significant variation in Phaethon spectral slope in the wavelength range [0.33-0.64] mu m during its perigeon passage. The slope varies from -9.1 +/- 0.2%(/0.1 mu m) on 2017-Dec-16 to -2.0 +/- 0.1%(/0.1 mu m) on 2017-Dec-17. This variation seems to be related to a disappearing bluer region at high latitudes (> 70 degrees, close to the North pole). The spectra show also a weak absorption band around 0.43 mu m and lack the reflectance downturn at least until similar to 0.33 mu m. The comparison with meteorites suggests compositional similarities with Cl/CM unusual chondrites. We propose several scenarios that could be responsible for the variability recorded, such as possible surface variations in composition, grain-size, or the level of space weathering and thermal metamorphism. A strong and sudden variation of dust production is also discussed.",64,1,2019,10.1016/j.pss.2018.11.006,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2018.11.006,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Lazzarin, M, Petropoulou, V, Bertini, I, La Forgia, F, Ochner, P, Migliorini, A, Siviero, A, (2019).

Analysis of the observations by the Minor Planet Center established that the object, identified as J002E3, was in a geocentric rather than heliocentric orbit. This extremely unusual orbit prompted a flurry of observational and analytic interest. Detailed analysis of incoming position observations at the JPL Near-Earth Object Program Office deten-nined that the object was in an unstable, 42-day period orbit about the Earth. They concluded that this orbital behavior was inconsistent with a natural solar system body like an asteroid but was very consistent with a man-made body launched from the Earth. Their analysis of the orbital characteristics and the timeline pointed to the upper SIVB stage of the Apollo 12 launch in November 1969. The measured spectra of J002E3 match white paint better than asteroid surface materials, and the measured photometric characteristics indicate that J002E3 does not appear to be an asteroid.

The results show rotation periods from 2.3 to almost 26 h. Some objects exhibit amplitudes higher than one magnitude on their lightcurves (1999 JD(6), 2000 CK33 and 2003 NZ(6)). Phase curve values (beta, H'''', see below) were derived for four Atens and H-G values were found for two. Five Atens were classified by using their B-V and V-R color indices. This taxonomy was compared with the phase coefficient-albedo correlation defined by Belskaya and Shevchenko [Belskaya, I.N., Shevchenko, V.G., 2000. Icarus 147, 94-105]. Color variations during rotation and phase angle change were searched for. Our study demonstrates the high variety among Atens. Five out of the eight Atens are binaries or possible binaries, a significantly higher fraction than the expected 15% [Bottke, W.F., Melosh, H.J., 1996. Nature 281, 51-53]. The lightcurve of 2000 PJ(5) exhibits a binary character with a probable highly eccentric orbital rotation of the secondary component. The different periods of the known binary 1999 HF1''''s are easily detected. Other Atens have lightcurve with features such as high amplitude, V-shaped minima and U-shaped maxima that can be interpreted as a binary asteroid with a synchronous rotation (2003 NZ(6), 2000 CK33 and perhaps also 1999 JD(6)).

These data represent the first high-quality ground-based observations of a bare Halley-type comet nucleus and provide the best characterization of a Halley-type comet other than 1P/Halley itself. Analysis of time series photometry suggests that the nucleus has a rotation period of 57.2 +/- 0.5 h with a minimum nuclear axial ratio of 1.3, a phase-darkening slope parameter G of -0.01 +/- 0.10, and an estimated H = 13.05 +/- 0.10. The rotation period of C/2001 OG(108) is one of the longest observed among comet nuclei. The V-R color index for this object is measured to be 0.461 +/- 0.02, which is virtually identical to that of other cometary nuclei and other possible extinct comet candidates. Measurements of the comet''''s thermal emission constrain the projected elliptical nuclear radii to be 9.6 +/- 1.0 km and 7.4 +/- 1.0 km, which makes C/2001 OG(108) one of the larger cometary nuclei known. The derived geometric albedo in V-band of 0.040 +/- 0.010 is typical for comet nuclei. Visible-wavelength spectrophotometry and near-infrared spectroscopy were combined to derive the nucleus''''s reflectance spectrum over a 0.4 to 2.5 mu m wavelength range. These measurements represent one of the few nuclear spectra ever observed and the only known spectrum of a Halley-type comet. The spectrum of this comet nucleus is very nearly linear and shows no discernable absorption features at a 5% detection limit. The lack of any features, especially in the 0.8 to 1.0 mu m range such as are seen in the spectra of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and many low-albedo asteroids, is consistent with the presence of anhydrous rather than hydrous silicates on the surface of this comet. None of the currently recognized meteorites in the terrestrial collections have reflectance spectra that match C/2001 OG(108). The near-infrared spectrum, the geometric albedo, and the visible spectrophotometry all indicate that C/2001 OG(108) has spectral properties analogous to the D-type, and possibly P-type asteroids. Comparison of the measured albedo and diameter of C/2001 OG(108) with those of Damocloid asteroids reveals similarities between these asteroids and this comet nucleus, a finding which supports previous dynamical arguments that Damocloid asteroids could be composed of cometary-like materials. These observations are also consistent with findings that two Jupiter-family comets may have spectral signatures indicative of D-type asteroids. C/2001 OG(108) probably represents the transition from a typical active comet to an extinct cometary nucleus, and, as a Halley-type comet, suggests that some comets originating in the Oort cloud can become extinct without disintegrating. As a near-Earth object, C/2001 OG(108) supports the suggestion that some fraction of the near-Earth asteroid population consists of extinct cometary nuclei. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The assumption of activity (past or present) for a small body can be achieved indirectly by its identification as the parent of a meteor shower. In this framework, the near-Earth object (NEO) 2009 WN25 represents an interesting case study. The target, recovered in 2015, is the likely progenitor of a complex stream of meteor shower, and its peculiar high-eccentricity, high-inclination orbit, with an aphelion as far as Jupiter, is responsible for the meteoroid long-term stability. We investigated the physical characteristics of 2009 WN25, by obtaining spectral observations from ESO-NTT and ESO-VLT to constrain its surface composition. We also compared the observed spectra with meteorite data present in the RELAB database and obtained from other laboratories. We found for 2009 WN25 a primitive D-type composition, in agreement with being a cometary progenitor. The low-albedo nature we derived implies a km-sized body, making it one of the few D-type NEOs in this size range. The two spectra we obtained have a similar spectral slope in the 0.5-0.9 mu m range, suggesting a possible homogeneous surface. Finally, by comparison with meteorite data we found an association with an unaltered sample of the rare meteorite Tagish Lake.

Its investigation can provide crucial information on the origin and early evolution of the solar system, and shed light on the delivery of water and organic-rich material to the early Earth. Furthermore, the possible impact of NEOs poses a serious hazard to our planet. There is an urgent need to undertake a comprehensive physical characterization of the NEO population, particularly for the ones with the higher likelihood of catastrophic impact with the Earth. One of the main aims of the NEOShield-2 project (2015-2017), financed by the European Commission in the framework of the HORIZON 2020 program, is to undertake an extensive observational campaign and provide a physical and compositional characterization for a large number of NEOs in the <300 m size range, retrieving in particular their mitigation-relevant properties (size, shape, albedo, diameter, composition, internal structure, ...) in order to design impact mitigation missions and assess the consequences of an impact on Earth. We carried out visible photometric measurements for a sample of 158 uncharacterized NEOs. We also made use of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy to assess NEO composition and perform a mineralogical analysis. We found that carbonaceous C-complex asteroids deserve a special attention, since their physical structure (e.g., primitive nature, porosity) and their orbital parameters (mainly the inclination) make at the moment challenging the design of a successful mitigation strategy. Indeed, the most advanced mitigation technique (the kinetic impactor) is less effective on these bodies, and the high inclination of some possible impactors require a launch vehicle capability beyond the one currently available.",17,8,2017,10.1140/epjp/i2017-11622-6,,http://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/i2017-11622-6,Physics,"Ieva, S, Dotto, E, Epifani, EM, Perna, D, Perozzi, E, Micheli, M, (2017).

We performed visible and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, as well as polarimetric observations. Polarimetric and spectroscopic data allowed us to classify 2004 VD17 as an E-type asteroid. A good agreement was also found with the spectrum of the aubrite meteorite Mayo Belwa. On the basis of the polarimetric albedo (p(v) = 0.45) and of photometric data, we estimated a diameter of about 320 m and a rotational period of about 2 h. The analysis of the results obtained by our complete survey have shown that (144898) 2004 VD17 is a peculiar NEO, since it is close to the breakup limits for fast rotator asteroids, as defined by Pravec and Harris [Pravec, P., Harris, AW., 2000.

Each of these methods relies on a mitigation concept (deflection or fragmentation), an energy source (e.g. kinetic, gravitational, solar, thermal, etc.) and a mode of approach (e.g. remote station and interaction). The efficiency of each method depends on the physical properties of the considered NEO that influence the way the body will respond to the considered energy source. While the knowledge of properties such as the mass, spin rate and obliquity as well as the shape is generally required for all mitigation methods, there are other properties that are important to know for some methods and that have no great influence for other ones. This paper summarizes the current knowledge of main physical properties of NEOs and their importance for the most usual mitigation strategies that have been proposed, i.e. the kinetic impactor, the gravity tractor, strategies based on anchoring or depositing material on the surface, and strategies aimed at modifying the thermal properties of the NEO in order to either modify or cancel the Yarkovsky effect, or cause surface vaporization.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of literature covering meteor generated shock wave phenomena, from the aspect of both meteor science and hypersonic gas dynamics. The primary emphasis of this review is placed on the mechanisms and dynamics of the meteor shock waves. We discuss key aspects of both shock generation and propagation, including the great importance of the hydrodynamic shielding that develops around the meteoroid. In addition to this in-Departmenth review, the discussion is extended to an overview of meteoroid fragmentation, followed by airburst type events associated with large, deep penetrating meteoroids. This class of objects has a significant potential to cause extensive material damage and even human casualties on the ground, and as such is of great interest to the planetary defense community. To date, no comprehensive model exists that accurately describes the flow field and shock wave formation of a strongly ablating meteoroid in the non-continuum flow regime. Thus, we briefly present the current state of numerical models that describe the comparatively slower flow of air over non-ablating bodies in the rarefied regime. In respect to the elusive nature of meteor generated shock wave detection, we also discuss relevant aspects and applications of meteor radar and infrasound studies as tools that can be utilized to study meteor shock waves and related phenomena. In particular, infrasound data can provide energy release estimates of meteoroids entering the Earth''s atmosphere. We conclude with a summary of unresolved questions in the domain of meteor generated shock waves; topics which should be a focus of future investigations in the field. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

NEOs are asteroids or comets that have perihelion distances less than or equal to 1.3 astronomical units, and can have orbits that cross that of the Earth. Therefore, the most suitable targets for the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) are those NEOs in heliocentric orbits similar to Earth''''s (i.e. low inclination and low eccentricity). One of the significant advantages of this type of mission is that it strengthens and validates the foundational infrastructure of the United States Space Exploration Policy and is highly complementary to NASA''''s planned lunar sortie and Outpost missions circa 2020. A human expedition to a NEO Would not only underline the broad utility of the Orion CEV and Ares launch systems, but would also be the first human expedition to an interplanetary body beyond the Earth-Moon system, These deep space operations will present unique challenges not present in lunar missions for the onboard crew, spacecraft systems, and mission control team. Executing several piloted NEO missions will enable NASA to gain crucial deep space operational experience, which will be necessary prerequisites for the eventual human missions to Mars. Our NEO learn will present and discuss the following: new mission trajectories and concepts; operational command and control considerations; expected science, operational, resource utilization, and impact mitigation returns; and continued exploration momentum and future Mars exploration benefits.

In addition to the direct scientific value, precise orbital determinations can be obtained from planetary radar observations, which are in turn valuable for mission planning or spacecraft navigation and planetary defense. The next-generation Very Large Array would not have to be equipped with a transmitter to be an important asset in the world''''s planetary radar infrastructure. Bistatic radar, in which one antenna transmits (e.g., Arecibo or Goldstone) and another receives, are used commonly today, with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) serving as a receiver. The improved sensitivity of the ngVLA relative to the GBT would improve the signal-to-noise ratios on many targets and increase the accessible volume specifically for asteroids.

When any threat cannot be realistically placed on a reasonable scale showing its importance, then a securitization process known from the critical security studies in international relations is an approach to analyze it. Analysis of the securitization process is usually used to unveil real intentions behind legitimization of exceptional politics, but it can also be used to justify its credibility. In other words, the way we talk, argue, and discuss the threat constructs our perception of its severity, magnitude, and relevance. PD has one significant advantage: It deals with easily scientifically confirmable threats that can help to justify the securitization move. Despite the hard science behind PD, additional interests of the involved actors may contribute toward related policy decisions: national prestige, commercial boost multiplier, advancement of scientific research, or simply the demand for a more responsible global governance. I introduce the reader into the realm of securitization theory and assess the special case of PD in its light. Later, I argue why a cosmopolitan mindset rather than a cosmopolitan actor is the key on how to reach PD readiness without global security concerns. This mindset can be enabled by global commercial actors as they can play a significant and a good role in our realm of nation states that usually share consensus over a need of good global governance. In the final part, this article provides a brief policy architecture based on a cosmopolitan mindset, including a roadmap for reaching it. The resulting commercial infrastructure with a PD capability can serve commerce, science, and national prestige at once while representing a giant leap to space and an unprecedented advance to human collective behavior.",37,12,2017,10.1089/space.2017.0005,,http://doi.org/10.1089/space.2017.0005,Engineering,"Schmidt, N, (2017).

This collision will disrupt the larger asteroid or alter its trajectory, thereby demonstrating a capability to prevent such an asteroid from colliding with Earth. The concept of redirecting a smaller asteroid into a larger asteroid is attractive for this type of mission because it uses natural kinetic energy available beyond Earth''''s gravity well for the majority of the energy delivered to the larger asteroid. By contrast, a kinetic impactor launched directly from Earth to its target must have all of its mass lifted out of Earth''''s gravity well. The proposed architecture allows for an impact energy of several terajoules without the use of nuclear devices. This work presents a novel approach to this type of kinetic impactor mission. In the proposed concept of operations, a spacecraft performs a controlled rendezvous and capture of the smaller asteroid. It then uses solar electric propulsion to redirect the asteroid over time onto a collision course. A high-thrust terminal guidance system is used to perform final trajectory adjustments in the hours leading to collision with the larger asteroid, ensuring a successful interception.",37,9,2017,10.2514/1.A33753,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.A33753,Engineering,"Marcus, ML, Sloane, JB, Ortiz, OB, Barbee, BW, (2017).

This work improves the gravity tractor asteroid deflection approach by tracking realistic small body shapes with tilted ion engines. An algorithm for polyhedron tracking was evaluated in a fictitious impact scenario. The simulations suggest a capability increase up to 38.2% with such improved tilting strategies. The long- and short-term effects within polyhedron tracking are illustrated. In particular, the orbital reorientation effect is influential when realistic asteroid shapes and rotations are accounted for. Also analyzed is the subject of altitude profiles, a way to tailor the gravity tractor performance, and to achieve a steering ability within the B-plane. A novel analytical solution for the classic gravity tractor is derived. It removes the simulation need for classic tractor designs to obtain comparable two body model Delta v figures. This paper corroborates that the asteroid shape can be exploited for maximum performance. Even a single engine tilt adjustment at the beginning of deflection operations yields more deflection than a fixed preset tilt. (C) 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such a deflection demonstration attempt has to be cost effective, easy to validate, and safe in the sense that harmless asteroids must not be turned into potentially hazardous objects. Uncertainties in an asteroid''''s orbital and physical parameters as well as those additionally introduced during a mitigation attempt necessitate an in depth analysis of deflection mission designs in order to dispel planetary safety concerns. We present a post mitigation impact risk analysis of a list of potential kinetic impactor based deflection demonstration missions proposed in the framework of the NEOShield project. Our results confirm that mitigation induced uncertainties have a significant influence on the deflection outcome. Those cannot be neglected in post deflection impact risk studies. We show, furthermore, that deflection missions have to be assessed on an individual basis in order to ensure that asteroids are not inadvertently transported closer to the Earth at a later date. Finally, we present viable targets and mission designs for a kinetic impactor test to be launched between the years 2025 and 2032. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results of the analysis indicate a diameter of 0.56 kilometers (km) and an albedo of 0.08. 2007 LE exhibits a 1-pm absorption feature without a discernible Band II feature. Compositional analysis of 2007 LE reveal Fs17 and Fa19 values, which are consistent with the Fa and Fs values for the H-type ordinary chondrites (Fs(14.5_18) and Fa(16-20)) and of Asteroid (6) Hebe (Fs17 and Fa15). Spectroscopically, 2007 LE does not appear like the average H-chondrite spectra, exhibiting a reddened spectrum and subdued absorption feature.

The neutral beam for asteroid control (NBAC) technology is a globally neutral plasma thruster that seeks to fill the operational gap between high impulse and slow push asteroid deflection methods. It is unlike other propulsive methods in that it does not tether to the asteroid or expel charged ion beams. Additionally, NBAC can be used to modify both the spin state and trajectory of an asteroid. In this work, NBAC''''s performance is discussed for a range of asteroid sizes and spectral types for de-spin and deflection using the orbit of the hypothetical asteroid 2017 PDC. The analysis assumes that several NBAC-equipped spacecraft are deployed, each with 10 keV neutral beam emitter. The achieved deflection and the applicability of NBAC to a deflection campaign is presented. Calculations for achieved deflection are done using the General Mission Analysis Tool with gravitational perturbations from major bodies included. Loss of a spacecraft during deflection and its effect on mission success is also investigated. One major requirement in this work is adaptability of the NBAC-based concept to deflection campaigns where the asteroid has not been fully characterized. This work demonstrates how uncertainty in asteroid composition is factored into propellant and deflection time requirements for NBAC. Assuming one perihelion passage, NBAC can successfully deflect 2017 PDC given a size range of 100-150 m for S, C, B, and Xc-type asteroids. Failure of a one or two NBAC-carrying spacecraft during deflection does not preclude successful deflection for a set of sizes and densities. NBAC can be used to arrest asteroid rotations through hovering spacecraft that track the asteroid in its rotating frame. We present a general formulation for angular momentum of a monolithic, single boulder asteroid considering both its rotational and orbital angular momentum. We find that while arresting the rotation for this type of asteroid, it is likely to change its orbit as well. A variety of stable and unstable asteroid rotation states for the asteroid size are used. Propellant usage and time required to fully de-spin representative asteroids will be presented. Additionally, the time required for total de-spin will be compared to the time required for partial arrest. Partial arrest of unstable spinners is possible under mission constraints for a set of asteroid sizes and densities. Additionally, total arrest can be achieved for less than 60 kg per spacecraft for a four-spacecraft NBAC system.",15,,2018,,,,Engineering,"DeCicco, AJ, Hartzell, CM, Adams, RB, Polzin, KA, (2018).

In this situation, a rendezvous mission becomes impractical due to the resulting NEO intercept velocity exceeding 10 km/s. Because the conventional penetrating NEDs require the impact speed to be less than 300 m/s, an innovative concept of blending a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion has been proposed for optimal penetration, fragmentation, and dispersion of the target NEO. A proposed hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system (HNIS) consists of a kinetic-impact leader spacecraft and a follower spacecraft carrying NEDs. This paper describes the conceptual development and design of an HNIS, including thermal shielding of a follower spacecraft, targeting sensors and optical instruments of a leader spacecraft, terminal guidance propulsion systems, and other secondary configurations. Simulations using a hydrodynamic code are conducted to calculate the optimal separation distance between the two vehicles and the thermal and structural limitations encountered by the follower spacecraft carrying NEDs.",23,,2012,,,,Engineering,"Pitz, A, Kaplinger, B, Wie, B, Dearborn, D, (2012).

Given the strong evidence that asteroids are seismically active, an in-situ passive seismic experiment could provide information about the asteroid surface and interior properties. Here, we discuss the natural seismic activity that may be present on Didymoon, the secondary component of asteroid (65803) Didy-mos. Our analysis of the tidal stresses in Didymoon shows that tidal quakes are likely to occur if the secondary has an eccentric orbit. Failure occurs most easily at the asteroid poles and close to the surface for both homogeneous and layered internal structures. Simulations of seismic wave propagation in Didymoon show that the seismic moment of even small meteoroid impacts can generate clearly observable body and surface waves if the asteroid''''s internal structure is homogeneous. The presence of a regolith layer over a consolidated core can result in the seismic energy becoming trapped in the regolith due to the strong impedance contrast at the regolith-core boundary. The inclusion of macro porosity (voids) further complexifles the wavefield due to increased scattering. The most prominent seismic waves are always found to be those traveling along the surface of the asteroid and those focusing in the antipodal point of the seismic source. We find also that the waveforms and ground acceleration spectra allow discrimination between the different internal structure models. Although the science return of a passive seismic experiment would be enhanced by having multiple seismic stations, one single seismic station can already vastly improve our knowledge about the seismic environment and sub-surface structure of an asteroid. We describe several seismic measurement techniques that could be applied in order to study the asteroid internal structure with one three-component seismic station.",116,9,2017,10.1016/j.pss.2017.05.005,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2017.05.005,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Murdoch, N, Hempel, S, Pou, L, Cadu, A, Garcia, RF, Mimoun, D, Margerin, L, Karatekin, O, (2017).

Our model indicates that similar to 0.1% (a factor of two uncertainty) of the steady-state NEO population (perihelion q < 1.3 AU) is on retrograde orbits. These rare outcomes typically happen when asteroid orbits flip to a retrograde configuration while in the 3: 1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter and then live for similar to 0.001 to 100 Myr. The model predicts, given the estimated near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, that a few retrograde 0.1-1 km NEAs should exist. Currently, there are two known MPC NEOs with asteroidal designations on retrograde orbits which we therefore claim could be escaped asteroids instead of devolatilized comets.

The closest or slowest approaches yield the most violent ''s-class'' disruption events where the largest remaining fragment after disruption and reaccumulation retains less than 50% of the parent''s mass. The resulting fragments have a ''string of pearls'' configuration after their reaccummulation into gravitationally bound components (Richardson, D.C., Bottke, W.F., Love, S.G. [1998]. Icarus 134,47-76). We found that the average absolute magnitude (H) difference between the parent body and the largest fragment is Delta H similar to 1.0. The average slope of the absolute magnitude (H) distribution, N(H) proportional to 10((0.55 +/-.04) H), for the fragments in the s-class families is steeper than the slope of the NEO population (Mainzer, A., et al. [2011]. Astrophys. J. 743, 156) in the same size range. The es remain coherent as statistically significant clusters of orbits within the NEO population for an average of (tau) over bar (c) = (14.7 +/- 0.6) x 10(3) yr after disruption. The detectable lifetimes of tidally disrupted families are extremely short compared to the multi-Myr and -Gyr lifetimes of main belt families due to the chaotic dynamical environment in NEO space they are detectable with the techniques developed by Fu et al. and Schunova et al. (Fu, H., Jedicke, R., Durda, D.D., Fevig, R., Binzel, R.P. [2005]. Icarus 178(2), 434-449 and Schunova, E., Granvik, M., Jedicke, R., Gronchi, G., Wainscoat, R., Abe, S. [2012]. Icarus 220, 1050-1063) for an average duration ((tau) over bar (det)) ranging from about 2000 to about 12,000 years for progenitors in the absolute magnitude (Ha) range from 20 to 13 corresponding to diameters in the range from about 0.5 to 10 km respectively. The maximum absolute magnitude of a progenitor capable of producing an observable NEO family (i.e. detectable by our family finding technique) is H-p,H-max = 20 (about 350 m diameter). The short detectability lifetime explains why zero NEO families have been discovered to-date. Nonetheless, every tidal disruption event of a progenitor with diameter greater than 0.5 km is capable of producing several million fragments in the 1-10 m diameter range that can contribute to temporary local density enhancements of small NEOs in Earth''s vicinity. We expect that there are about 1200 objects in the steady state NEO population in this size range due to tidal disruption assuming that one 1 km diameter NEO tidally disrupts at Earth every 2500 years. These objects may be suitable targets for asteroid retrieval missions due to their Earth-like orbits with corresponding low v,,, which permits low-cost missions. The fragments from the tidal disruptions evolve into orbits that bring them into collision with terrestrial planets or the Sun or they may be ejected from the Solar System on hyperbolic orbits due to deep planetary encounters. The end-state for the fragments from a tidal disruption at Earth have similar to 5 x the collision probability with Earth compared to the background NEO population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Three arrays were tested-one with 800-mu m substrate intact, one with 30-mu m substrate, and one completely substrate-removed. The CdZnTe substrate, on which the HgCdTe detector is grown, has been shown to produce luminescence in shorter wave HgCdTe arrays that causes an elevated signal in nonhit pixels when subjected to proton irradiation. This testing was conducted to ascertain whether or not full substrate removal is necessary. At the dark level of the dewar, we detect no luminescence in nonhit pixels during proton testing for both the substrate-removed detector array and the array with 30-mu m substrate. The detector array with full 800-mu m substrate exhibited substantial photocurrent for a flux of 103 protons/cm(2) s at a beam energy of 18.1 MeV (similar to 750 e(-)/s) and 34.4 MeV (similar to 65 e(-)/s). For the integrated space-like ambient proton flux level measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the luminescence would be well below the NEOCam dark current requirement of < 200 e(-)/s, but the pattern of luminescence could be problematic, possibly complicating calibration.

The European contribution to AIDA is the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), which will characterize in detail the Didymos system, investigating the surface, subsurface, and internal properties of the asteroid. This paper presents a possible Radio Science Experiment (RSE) to be performed with AIM focused at its precise orbit determination within the Didymos system, providing an assessment of the accuracies achievable in the estimation of the scientific parameters of interest, like the masses and the extended gravity fields of Didymos primary and secondary, their relative orbit, and their rotational states. The experiment expected performances were assessed through numerical simulations, based upon a complete and realistic dynamical model of the Didymos system and the AIM spacecraft. Given the small mass of the Didymos system, optical navigation images proved to be crucial to obtain good accuracies for the scientific parameters of interest, even keeping AIM at relatively large distances from Didymos. At 10 km, after 8 flybys dedicated to gravity science, the masses of the primary and secondary can be estimated to about 0.2% and 1.6% (1-sigma), respectively, with the mass of the secondary being mainly given by observing the wobble of the primary around the common center of mass due to the mutual orbital motion; the orbital motion of the secondary around the primary can be estimated to about 1 m, and the pole orientation of the primary and the secondary can be estimated to about 0.1 deg and 0.4 deg, respectively (1-sigma).

In STAIF03, we showed the commonality between the theories for acoustic and optical positioning/shaping methods. Using this theoretical framework, we developed a simple engineering estimation scheme to predict the acceleration per unit intensity. The radiation pressure is achieved by interaction of electromagnetic waves and particles of a given dielectric material and size. The theory was limited to the Rayleigh domain, where particle size is much less than the wavelength, and isotropic scattering could be assumed. With this theoretical framework in hand, we now consider how electromagnetic waves could be utilized in a Space-based construction project. In the test case project, the question of how to construct a safe radiation shelter for humans, in the Near-Earth Object (NEO) region is considered. NEO material, pulverized to an average particle size of 0.1 m radius, is formed into desired shapes using the radiation pressure and gradient forces experienced by dielectric objects in a standing-wave field of radio waves. The force field is produced by solar-powered transmitter/antenna carrying spacecraft, which are positioned in formation around the particle cloud to set up a resonant field of the desired mode. As a test case, formation of cylindrical shells is considered. The field level is set to induce an average particle acceleration of a millionth of an Earth-surface gravitational acceleration. Once in position, the particles are fused by solar-powered energy beams through a sintering process. Results show that 50m diameter, 50m-tall cylinders can be formed in the course of 12 to 13 hours per cylinder. Order-of-magnitude arguments show that the selected acceleration level is adequate to overcome noise from all other forces in this region. The paper also begins the consideration of tradeoffs between solar collector area, number of resonators, and capacitive storage-discharge of energy in the fabrication process.",6,,2004,,,,Engineering; Nuclear Science & Technology; Physics,"Komerath, NM, Wanis, SS, (2004).

Rapid design and optimization of low-thrust rendezvous/interception trajectories is considered as one of the key technologies to successfully deflect potentially hazardous asteroids. In this paper, we address a general framework for the rapid design and optimization of low-thrust rendezvous/interception trajectories for future asteroid deflection missions. The design and optimization process includes three closely associated steps. Firstly, shape-based approaches and genetic algorithm (GA) are adopted to perform preliminary design, which provides a reasonable initial guess for subsequent accurate optimization. Secondly, Radau pseudospectral method is utilized to transcribe the low-thrust trajectory optimization problem into a discrete nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. Finally, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is used to efficiently solve the nonlinear programming problem and obtain the optimal low-thrust rendezvous/interception trajectories. The rapid design and optimization algorithms developed in this paper are validated by three simulation cases with different performance indexes and boundary constraints. (C) 2013 COSPAR.

Most of them require that a probe is inserted in orbit around the object to obtain accurate physical and orbital data. Asteroid 99942 Apophis is a member of the A ten group of asteroids, having orbital, periods shorter than I year. Such an asteroid is used here as a practical example to investigate the characteristics of new mission concepts and as a candidate for a potential space agency project aimed to tag an asteroid either for scientific purposes or for a deflection mission decision. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potentialities offered by a solar-sail-based rendezvous mission toward Apophis. In particular, rapid transfer trajectories are studied, that is, missions whose transfer times are less than one terrestrial year. We show that a realistic near-term mission option, with a transfer time of about 300 days, requires a solar sail with a characteristic acceleration of 0.5 mm/s(2). A square solar sail with a side of about 90 m is needed for a payload of 50 kg, whereas a greater sail with a side of 160 m is called for with a payload of 150 kg. The solar sail performance is compared to that achievable with conventional propulsion systems.",15,1,2009,10.2514/1.37141,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.37141,Engineering,"Mengali, G, Quarta, AA, (2009).

Icarus 156, 399-133] and the observing strategies of most asteroid search programs. With the recent expansion of survey capabilities, previous simulators focused on a specific survey facility are no longer useful in predicting the future detection rates. Our simulation is a superposition of simplified search patterns adopted by all major wide-field surveys in operation in both hemispheres. We defined five different simulation periods to follow the evolution of survey efficiencies reflecting changes in either search volume as a result of upgrades of telescopes and instruments or in observing schedules. The simulator makes remarkably good reproductions of actual survey results as of December 2005, not only the total number of detections but also (a, e, i, H) (''''H'''' means absolute magnitude of an asteroid) distributions. An extended experiment provides excellent predictions for discovery statistics of NEOs (H < 18) reported to the Minor Planet Center in 2006. These support that our simulator is a plausible approximation of real surveys. We further confirm that, with the Bottke et al.

Compared to other slow-push mitigation strategies, laser ablation allows for a significant reduction in fuel consumption since the ablated material is used as propellant. A precise modelling of the ablation process is however difficult due to the high variability in the physical parameters encountered among the different asteroids as well as the scarcity of experimental studies available in the literature. In this paper, we derive a new thermal model to simulate the efficiency of a laser-based deflector. The useful material properties are first derived from thermochemical tables and equilibrium thermodynamic considerations. These properties are then injected in a 3D axisymetrical thermal model developed in Mat lab. A temperature-dependant conduction flux is imposed on the exterior boundary condition that takes into account the balance between the incident power and the power losses due to the vaporization process across the Knudsen layer and the radiations respectively. A non-linear solver is finally used and the solution integrated over the ablation front to reconstruct the net thrust and the global mass flow. Compared to an initial 1D model, this new approach shows the importance of the parietal radiation losses in the case of a CW laser. Despite the low energy conversion efficiency, this new model still demonstrates the theoretical benefit of using lasers over more conventional low-thrust strategies.",12,,2014,10.1117/12.2060810,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2060810,Optics; Physics,"Thiry, N, Vasile, M, (2014).

The system is based on recent advances in high efficiency photonic systems. The system could also be used for propulsion of kinetic or nuclear tipped asteroid interceptors or other interplanetary spacecraft. A photon drive is possible using direct photon pressure on a spacecraft similar to a solar sail. Given a laser power of 70GW, a 100 kg craft can be propelled to 1AU in approximately 3 days achieving a speed of 0.4% the speed of light, and a 10,000 kg craft in approximately 30 days. We call the system DE-STAR for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation. DE-STAR is a modular phased array of solid-state lasers, powered by photovoltaic conversion of sunlight. The system is scalable and completely modular so that sub elements can be built and tested as the technology matures. The sub elements can be immediately utilized for testing as well as other applications including space debris mitigation. The ultimate objective of DE-STAR would be to begin direct asteroid vaporization and orbital modification starting at distances beyond 1 AU. Using phased array technology to focus the beam, the surface spot temperature on the asteroid can be raised to more than 3000K, allowing evaporation of all known substances. Additional scientific uses of DE-STAR are also possible.",10,,2013,10.1117/12.2035346,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2035346,Optics; Physics,"Bible, J, Johansson, I, Hughes, GB, Lubin, PM, (2013).

The best witness of these events is the lunar surface, which kept the memory of the impacts that it underwent during the last 3.8 Gyr. In this paper, we review the recent studies at the origin of a reliable model of the impactor population in the inner solar system, namely the near-Earth object (NEO) population. Then we briefly expose the scaling laws used to relate a crater diameter to body size. The model of the NEO population and its impact frequency on terrestrial planets is consistent with the crater distribution on the lunar surface when appropriate scaling laws are used. Concerning the early phases of our solar system''''s history, a scenario has recently been proposed that explains the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) and some other properties of our solar system. In this scenario, the four giant planets had initially circular orbits, were much closer to each other, and were surrounded by a massive disk of planetesimals. Dynamical interactions with this disk destabilized the planetary system after 500-600 Myr. Consequently, a large portion of the planetesimal disk, as well as 95% of the Main Belt asteroids, were sent into the inner solar system, causing the LHB while the planets reached their current orbits. Our knowledge of solar system evolution has thus improved in the last decade despite our still-poor understanding of the complex cratering process.",45,11,2007,10.1111/j.1945-5100.2007.tb00545.x,,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2007.tb00545.x,Geochemistry & Geophysics,"Michel, P, Morbidelli, A, (2007).

An example of this methodology is applied to planetary defense.

However, this policy of nuclear deflection could inadvertently increase the risk of nuclear war and other violent conflict. This article conducts risk-risk tradeoff analysis to assess whether nuclear deflection results in a net increase or decrease in risk. Assuming nonnuclear deflection options are also used, nuclear deflection may only be needed for the largest and most imminent asteroid collisions. These are low-frequency, high-severity events. The effect of nuclear deflection on violent conflict risk is more ambiguous due to the complex and dynamic social factors at play. Indeed, it is not clear whether nuclear deflection would cause a net increase or decrease in violent conflict risk.

The AIM spacecraft is described in the paper, focusing on the vision-based GNC strategy that reached a high level of maturity at the end of the Consolidation Phase (post B1). Ground navigation analyses pointed out that for close proximity operations (distances under 20 km) a certain degree of autonomy is required. A semi-autonomous attitude guidance has been developed to guarantee that the asteroid will always be kept in the camera Field of View. This algorithm will apply a delta quaternion to the reference attitude profile provided by ground control in order to correct the pointing to the body. This technology has been designed to be easily validated and, at the same time, constrained: the delta quaternion can be limited and in case the thresholds are crossed or any failure occurs, the ground-based reference attitude profile will be used. The AIM GNC prototype was updated to use Line of Sight measurements provided by a centroiding algorithm designed and autocoded in Matlab/Simulink, then validated up to Processor-in-the-loop tests using a flight representative processor (AT697E LEON2-FT @ 80 MHz). The algorithm is based on the correlation of the image with a Lambertian sphere, taking advantage of the almost spherical shape of Didymain. When relative distance to the binary system is below 8 km, the feature tracking algorithm is used. In this paper a specific case is assessed: the close fly-by for MASCOT-2 delivery (lander included in the payload for AIM''''s phase B1), tested up to Hardware-in-the-loop with the AIM Framing Camera.",18,11,2018,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.08.051,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.08.051,Engineering,"Pellacani, A, Cabral, F, Alcalde, A, Kicman, P, Lisowski, J, Gerth, I, Burmann, B, (2018).

Depending on warning time, it can be effective on asteroids with diameters of a few hundred meters. Current impact deflection research often focuses on the orbital dynamics of asteroids. In this paper, we use the ejection outcome of a general oblique impact to calculate how an asteroid''''s rotational and translational state changes after impact. The results demonstrate how small impactors affect the dynamical state of small asteroids having a diameter of about 100 m. According to these consequences, we propose using several small impactors to hit an asteroid continuously and gently, making the deflection mission relatively flexible. After calculating the rotational variation, we find that the rotational state, especially of slender non-porous asteroids, can be changed significantly. This gives the possibility of using multiple small impactors to mitigate a potentially hazardous asteroid by spinning it up into pieces, or to despin one for future in-situ investigation (e.g., asteroid retrieval or mining).

A better understanding of the physical properties of Phaethon is needed to understand the nature of its current and previous activity, relationship to potential source populations, and to plan for the upcoming flyby of the DESTINY+ spacecraft of Phaethon in the 2020s. We performed rotationally resolved spectroscopy of Phaethon at visible and near-infrared wavelengths (0.4-2.5 mu m) in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to better understand its surface properties. The visible and near-infrared observations both spanned nearly a full rotation or more and were under similar observing geometries, covering the entire surface with the exception of the north pole. The visible wavelengths show blue slopes with only minor slope variations and no absorption features. The NIR data is minimally varying and concave upwards, from very blue to blue-neutral with increasing wavelength. We fit the short-wavelength tail of Phaethon''''s thermal emission and retrieve an average visible albedo of p(v) = 0.08 +/- 0.01, which is lower than previous measurements but plausible in light of the recent larger radar-measured diameter of Phaethon. We retrieve an average infrared beaming parameter of Phaethon of eta = 1.70 +/- 0.05, which is similar to previous results.

The European Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is set to rendezvous with the asteroid system to fully characterize the smaller of the two binary components a few months prior to the impact by the US Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft. AIM is a unique mission as it will be the first time that a spacecraft will investigate the surface, subsurface, and internal properties of a small binary near-Earth asteroid. In addition it will perform various important technology demonstrations that can serve other space missions. The knowledge obtained by this mission will have great implications for our understanding of the history of the Solar System. Having direct information on the surface and internal properties of small asteroids will allow us to understand how the various processes they undergo work and transform these small bodies as well as, for this particular case, how a binary system forms. Making these measurements from up close and comparing them with ground-based data from telescopes will also allow us to calibrate remote observations and improve our data interpretation of other systems. With DART, thanks to the characterization of the target by AIM, the mission will be the first fully documented impact experiment at asteroid scale, which will include the characterization of the target''s properties and the outcome of the impact. AIDA will thus offer a great opportunity to test and refine our understanding and models at the actual scale of an asteroid, and to check whether the current extrapolations of material strength from laboratory-scale targets to the scale of AIDA''s target are valid. Moreover, it will offer a first check of the validity of the kinetic impactor concept to deflect a small body and lead to improved efficiency for future kinetic impactor designs. This paper focuses on the science return of AIM, the current knowledge of its target from ground-based observations, and the instrumentation planned to get the necessary data. (C) 2016 COSPAR.

The ideal mission profile would involve two or three astronauts on a 90 to 180 day flight, which would include a 7 to 14 day stay for proximity operations at the target NEO. This mission would be the first human expedition to an interplanetary body beyond the Earth-Moon system and would prove useful for testing technologies required for human missions to Mars and other solar system destinations. Piloted missions to NEOs using the CEV would undoubtedly provide a great deal of technical and engineering data on spacecraft operations for future human-space exploration while conducting in-Departmenth scientific investigations of these primitive objects. The main scientific advantage of sending piloted missions to NEOs would be the flexibility of the crew to perform tasks and to adapt to Situations in real time. A crewed vehicle would be able to test several different sample collection techniques and tat-get specific areas of interest via extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) more efficiently than robotic spacecraft. Such capabilities greatly enhance the scientific return from these missions to NEOs, destinations vital to understanding the evolution and thermal histories of primitive bodies during the formation of the early solar system. Data collected from these missions would help constrain the suite of materials possibly delivered to the early Earth, and would identify potential Source regions from which NEOs originate. In addition, the resulting scientific investigations would refine designs for future extraterrestrial resource extraction and utilization, and assist in the development of hazard mitigation techniques for planetary defense.",37,12,2009,10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.tb01991.x,,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.tb01991.x,Geochemistry & Geophysics,"Abell, P, Korsmeyer, DJ, Landis, R, Jones, TD, Adamo, DR, Morrison, DD, Lemke, LG, Gonzales, AA, Gershman, R, Sweetser, TH, Johnson, LN, and Lu, E, (2009).

A disk-integrated phase function was constructed, giving a geometric albedo of 0.055 +/- 0.012, phase integral of q = 0.34, and Bond albedo of A(B) = 0.019. The photometric property shows a profile similar to low albedo asteroids and comet nuclei. No emission lines were found in our spectrum, giving a flat reflectance similar to low albedo asteroids.

We used the technique proposed by Fu et al. (Fu, H., Jedicke, R., Durda, D.D., Fevig, R. Binzel, R.P. [2005] Icarus 178(2), 434-449) supplemented with a detailed analysis of the statistical significance of the detected clusters. Their significance was assessed by comparison to identical searches performed on 1000 ''fuzzy-real'' NEO orbit distribution models that we developed for this purpose. The family-free ''fuzzy-real'' NEO models maintain both the micro and macro distribution of five orbital elements (ignoring the mean anomaly). Three clusters were identified that contain four or more NEOs but none of them are statistically significant at >= 3 sigma. The most statistically significant cluster at the similar to 2 sigma level contains four objects with H < 20 and all members have long observational arcs and concomitant good orbital elements. Despite the low statistical significance we performed several other tests on the cluster to determine if it is likely a genetic family. The tests included examining the cluster''s taxonomy, size-frequency distribution, consistency with a family-forming event during tidal disruption in a close approach to Mars, and whether it is detectable in a proper element cluster search. None of these tests exclude the possibility that the cluster is a family but neither do they confirm the hypothesis. We conclude that we have not identified any NEO families.

These allow for efficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal Lyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including optimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the solution, like the classical Newton''s method. Typically, these methods have faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods which provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods. Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory optimization to asteroid deflection. We provide an implementation of first- and second-order variational equations for the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation allows the simultaneous integration of any number of first- and second-order variational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator. We also provide routines to generate consistent and accurate initial conditions without the need for finite differencing.",22,7,2016,10.1093/mnras/stw644,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw644,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Rein, H, and Tamayo, D, (2016).

Each transfer leg is defined by a semi-analytic model, and its solution is equivalent to a hybrid Lambert''''s problem. The method is suitable for approximating both flyby and rendezvous transfer legs. A branch and prune algorithm is used to generate a collection of initial guesses for further optimization. The analytic nature of the low-thrust model simplifies the pruning step, since dynamical and operational constraints (like maximum thrust or total Delta v) can be imposed easily. The solutions obtained with the global search algorithm can be post-processed, filtered, and ranked according to various criteria. This is where the versatility of the method resides, because changing the selection criteria does not require a new search. Selected candidates are then optimized further, in order to generate actual low-thrust orbits. Two mission design examples are presented: an asteroid deflection mission using a kinetic impactor, and a rendezvous mission to Jupiter. These examples are used to analyze the convergence of the optimization stage, in particular how far from the optimal solution the initial guesses are.",17,,2018,,,,Engineering,"Roa, J, Petropoulos, AE, Park, RS, (2018).

The NEO 2012 TC4 approached close to Earth at a distance of about 50,000 km in 2017 October. This close approach provided a practical exercise for planetary defense. This apparition was also an appropriate opportunity to investigate 2012 TC4, which is a monolithic asteroid. We conducted the observation campaign of 2012 TC4 using six small- and medium-sized telescopes. The multiband photometry analysis showed the taxonomic class of 2012 TC4 to be an X type. In particular, we successfully obtained the high time resolution light curve of 2012 TC4 with the Tomo-e Gozen camera, which is the world''''s first wide-field CMOS camera, mounted on the 1.05 m Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory. The shape and rotational motion models of 2012 TC4 were derived from the light curve. When 2012 TC4 was assumed to be a triaxial ellipsoid, the rotational and precession periods were 8.47 +/- 0.01 minutes and 12.25 +/- 0.01 minutes, respectively, with the long-axis mode. This indicates that 2012 TC4 is a tumbling and monolithic asteroid. The shape models showed the plausible axial lengths to be 6.2 x 8.0 x 14.9 m or 3.3 x 8.0 x 14.3 m. The flattened and elongated shape indicates that 2012 TC4 is a fragment produced by an impact event.

A sealed enclosure would make it possible to use an introduced atmosphere of xenon gas to detumble and despin the asteroid, and then to push the asteroid by using a steady xenon gas flow inside this enclosure to transfer the force of the spacecraft''s exterior solar electric propulsion engine to the asteroid. The gas will affect the cohesion forces of the asteroid, but the differential pressures exerted on the asteroid and surface regolith will be much less than the expected combined cohesion forces of weakly consolidated rubble piles and fragile primitive asteroids, which are of prime scientific interest for planetary defense and origin-of-life studies. That makes it possible to bring such a weakly consolidated asteroid mostly intact to the Earth-Moon system. Once released into lunar orbit, a small intact asteroid can be a viable proving ground for manned missions to more distant and larger asteroids in solar orbit. The development of this technology will benefit future asteroid resource utilization operations, in which enclosures are essential for providing protection from loose regolith and dust, capturing volatiles from icy objects, and enabling the use of reactive gasses in processing the asteroid material.",7,3,2015,10.1089/space.2014.0024,,http://doi.org/10.1089/space.2014.0024,Engineering,"Jenniskens, P, Damer, B, Norkus, R, Pilorz, S, Nott, J, Grigsby, B, Adams, C, and Blair, BR, (2015).

In addition to strength, equation of state, the initial state of the material including its competency (i.e. fractured or monolithic) and the amount of micro-or macroscopic porosity are important considerations to predict the thermomechanical response. There is recent interest in observing near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu due to its classification of being potentially hazardous with close approaches occurring every 6 years. Bennu is relatively large with a nominal diameter of 492 m, density estimates ranging from 0.9-1.26 g/cm(3) and is composed mainly of carbonaceous chondrite. There is a lack of data for highly porous carbonaceous chondrite at very large pressures and temperatures. In the absence of the specific material composition and state (e.g. layering, porosity as a function of depth) on Bennu we introduce a continuum constitutive model based on the response of granular materials and provide impact and standoff explosion simulations to investigate the response of highly porous materials to these types of impulsive loading scenarios. Simulations with impact speeds of 5 km/s show that the shock wave emanating from the impact site is highly dispersive and that a 10% porous material has a larger compacted volume compared with a 40% porous material with the same bulk density due to differences in compaction response. A three-dimensional simulation of a 190 kT standoff explosion 160 m off the surface of a shape model of Bennu estimated a deflection velocity of 10 cm/s.

Schemes to mitigate the impact threat have been studied extensively but tend to focus on asteroid diversion while neglecting the possibility of a comet threat. Such schemes often demand physically intercepting the target by spacecraft, a task feasible only for targets identified decades in advance in a restricted range of orbits. A threatening comet is unlikely to satisfy these criteria and so necessitates a fundamentally different approach for diversion. Comets are naturally perturbed from purely gravitational trajectories through solar heating of their surfaces which activates sublimation-driven jets. Artificial heating of a comet, such as by a high-powered laser array in Earth orbit, may supplement natural heating by the Sun to purposefully manipulate its path to avoid an impact. The effectiveness of any particular laser array for a given comet depends on the comet''''s heating response which varies dramatically depending on factors including nucleus size, orbit and dynamical history. These factors are incorporated into a numerical orbital model using established models of nongravitational perturbations to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using high-powered laser arrays in Earth orbit or on the ground to deflect a variety of comets. Simulation results suggest that orbital arrays of 500m and 10GW operating for 10 min/d over 1 yr may be adequate for mitigating impacts by comets up to similar to 500m in diameter. A 100m diffraction-limited ground-based array at 10GW may be similarly effective when appropriately located.",21,,2016,10.1117/12.2235711,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2235711,Optics,"Zhang, QC, Lubin, PM, Hughes, GB, (2016).

In this situation, a critical issue is the rotation of the asteroid relative to the directed energy beam, as this will reduce the average thrust magnitude and modify the thrust direction. Flux levels required to evaporate surface material depend on the surface material composition, rotation rate, albedo, and thermal and bulk mechanical properties of the asteroid. The observed distribution of asteroid rotation rates is used, along with an estimated range of material and mechanical properties, as input to a 4D thermal-physical model to calculate the resultant thrust vector. The model uses a directed energy beam, striking the surface of a rotating sphere with specified material properties, beam profile, and rotation rate. The model calculates thermal changes in the sphere, including vaporization and mass ejection of the target material. The amount of vaporization integrated over the target is used to determine the thrust magnitude and the phase shift relative to the non-rotating case. As the object rotates beneath the beam, the energy spreads out, decreasing temperature and vaporization causing both a phase shift and magnitude decrease in the average thrust vector. This produces a 4D analytical model of the expected thrust profile for rotating objects.",10,,2015,10.1117/12.2188476,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2188476,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,"Griswold, J, Madajian, J, Johansson, I, Pfau, K, Lubin, P, Hughes, G, Gilkes, A, Meinhold, P, Motta, C, Brashears, T, and Zhang, Q, (2015).

Adopting this example scenario, we show that solar sail spacecraft that impact the asteroid with a very high relative velocity are a realistic near-term option for mitigating the impact threat from near-Earth asteroids. The proposed mission requires several kinetic energy impactor solar sail spacecraft. Each kinetic energy impactor consists of a 160 x 160 m, 168-kg solar sail and a 150-kg impactor. Because of their large AV capability, solar sailcraft with a relatively modest characteristic acceleration of 0.5 mm/s(2) can achieve an orbit that is retrograde to the target orbit within less than about 4.5 years. Before impacting 2004 WR at its perihelion of about 0.75 AU, each impactor is to be separated from its solar sail. With a relative impact velocity of about 81 km/s, each impactor will cause a conservatively estimated A v of about 0.35 cm/s in the trajectory of the target asteroid, largely due to the impulsive effect of material ejected from the newly formed crater. The deflection caused by a single impactor will increase the Earth-miss distance by about 0.7 Earth radii. Several sailcraft will therefore be required for consecutive impacts, to increase the total Earth-miss distance to a safe value. In this paper, we elaborate on a potential mission scenario and investigate trade-offs between different mission parameters; for example, characteristic acceleration, sail temperature limit, hyperbolic excess energy for interplanetary insertion, and optical solar sail degradation.",39,7,2007,10.2514/1.22586,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.22586,Engineering,"Dachwald, B, Wie, B, (2007).

We outline the most likely and most efficient routes to develop solar sails for useful missions in science and applications, based on our developed ''''now-term'''' and near-term hardware as well as the many practical and managerial lessons learned from the DLR-ESTEC GOSSAMER Roadmap. Mission types directly applicable to planetary defense include single and Multiple NEA Rendezvous ((M)NR) for precursor, monitoring and follow-up scenarios as well as sail-propelled head-on retrograde kinetic impactors (RKI) for mitigation. Other mission types such as the Displaced L1 (DL1) space weather advance warning and monitoring or Solar Polar Orbiter (SPO) types demonstrate the capability of near-term solar sails to achieve asteroid rendezvous in any kind of orbit, from Earth-coorbital to extremely inclined and even retrograde orbits. Some of these mission types such as SPO, (M)NR and RKI include separable payloads. For one-way access to the asteroid surface, nanolanders like MASCOT are an ideal match for solar sails in micro-spacecraft format, i.e. in launch configurations compatible with ESPA and ASAP secondary payload platforms. Larger landers similar to the JAXA-DLR study of a Jupiter Trojan asteroid lander for the OKEANOS mission can shuttle from the sail to the asteroids visited and enable multiple NEA sample-return missions. The high impact velocities and re-try capability achieved by the RKI mission type on a final orbit identical to the target asteroid''''s but retrograde to its motion enables small spacecraft size impactors to carry sufficient kinetic energy for deflection.",231,,2019,,,,Engineering,"Grundmann, JT, Bauer, W, Borchers, K, Dumont, E, Grimm, CD, Ho, TM, Jahnke, R, Koch, AD, Lange, C, Maiwald, V, Mess, JG, Mikulz, E, Quantius, D, Reershemius, S, Renger, T, Sasaki, K, Seefeldt, P, Spietz, P, Sprowitz, T, Sznajder, M, Toth, N, Ceriotti, M, McInnes, C, Peloni, A, Biele, J, Krause, C, Dachwald, B, Hercik, D, Lichtenheldt, R, Wolff, F, Koncz, A, Pelivan, I, Schmitz, N, Boden, R, Riemann, J, Seboldt, W, Wejmo, E, Ziach, C, Mikschl, T, Montenegro, S, Ruffer, M, Cordero, F, Tardivel, S, (2019).

A multiple near-Earth asteroid rendezvous mission with close-up observations of several objects can help to improve the characterization of these asteroids. This work explores the design of a solar-sail spacecraft for such a mission, focusing on the search of possible sequences of encounters and the trajectory optimization. This is done in two sequential steps: a sequence search by means of a simplified trajectory model and a set of heuristic rules based on astrodynamics, and a subsequent optimization phase. A shape-based approach for solar sailing has been developed and is used for the first phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a fully optimized multiple near-Earth asteroid rendezvous mission. The results show that it is possible to visit five near-Earth asteroids within 10 years with near-term solar-sail technology.",34,12,2016,10.2514/1.G000470,,http://doi.org/10.2514/1.G000470,Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,"Peloni, A, Ceriotti, M, Dachwald, B, (2016).

WFIRST will provide imaging, spectroscopic, and coronagraphic capabilities from 0.43 to 2.0 mu m and will be a potential contemporary and eventual successor to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Surveys of irregular satellites and minor bodies are where WFIRST will excel with its 0.28 deg(2) field-of-view Wide Field Instrument. Potential ground-breaking discoveries from WFIRST could include detection of the first minor bodies orbiting in the inner Oort Cloud, identification of additional Earth Trojan asteroids, and the discovery and characterization of asteroid binary systems similar to Ida/Dactyl. Additional investigations into asteroids, giant planet satellites, Trojan asteroids, Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and comets are presented. Previous use of astrophysics assets for solar system science and synergies between WFIRST, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, JWST, and the proposed Near-Earth Object Camera mission is discussed. We also present the case for implementation of moving target tracking, a feature that will benefit from the heritage of JWST and enable a broader range of solar system observations.

Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids, comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner. Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.",26,,2015,10.1117/12.2186795,,http://doi.org/10.1117/12.2186795,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics,"Hughes, G, Lubin, P, Meinhold, P, O'Neill, H, Brashears, T, Zhang, Q, Griswold, J, Riley, J, and Motta, C, (2015).

It has been argued that space industrialisation generally offers a response to the risks involved by this class of event and should be the key focus of space infrastructure development. Space power has always been argued as the only energy generating option that avoids depletion of non-renewable resources or pollution induced problems-in particular global warming. However, there are many other potential roles for a solar power capability and the infrastructure associated with it can play in the prevention of global catastrophes and this paper examines this wider application. A very preliminary examination indicates the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) infrastructure can also support strategic defence, Near-Earth Object defence, climate modification, and major resource provision. Combined these may give the capability to deal with all the main threats to human civilisation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, solar wind sputtering is one of the most important agents for the surface erosion of a near-Earth object (NED). acting together with other surface release processes, such as photon stimulated desorption (PSD), thermal desorption (TD) and micrometeoroid impact vaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks at a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release processes produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in the energy range above 10eV and below a few keVs (sputtered high-energy atoms (SHEA)) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to NEO''''s extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give important information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental composition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function of the external conditions and the NED surface properties, is crucial for obtaining a clear view of the body''''s present loss rate as well as for getting clues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this work, an attempt to analyze processes that take place on the surface of these small airless bodies, as a result of their exposure to the space environment, has been realized. For this reason, a new space weathering model (space weathering on NEO-SPAWN) is presented. Moreover, an instrument concept of a neutral-particle analyzer specifically designed for the measurement of neutral density and the detection of SHEA from a NED is proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider the kinetic impactor, laser ablation, the ion beaming technique and two variants of the gravity tractor. A simple but realistic model of each deflection method was integrated within a systematic approach to size the spacecraft and predict the achievable deflection for a given mission and a given maximum mass at launch. A sample of 100 synthetic asteroids was then created from the current distribution of NEAs and global optimisation methods were used to identify the optimal solution in each case according to two criteria: the minimum duration between the departure date and the time of virtual impact required to deflect the NEA by more than two Earth radii and the maximum miss-distance achieved within a total duration of 10 years.

The increasing challenges of space exploration, particularly by humans, rapidly become unaffordable if only Earth-based resources are available. The Asteroid-Provided In-Situ Supplies (Apis (TM)) spacecraft extracts resources from NEOs. A crewed lunar outpost in an energetically advantageous lunar orbit is used for storage and propellant processing and reusable spacecraft are used for crew and cargo transport. This creates a space transportation system where these resources can be utilized to support crewed lunar surface exploration, crewed NEO exploration, crewed Mars missions, and even space tourism at less than 25% of the cost otherwise estimated for the current approach.

Hundreds of asteroids are discovered each year and that rate is increasing exponentially as technology improves. However, Chelyabinsk is a reminder that not every asteroid is observed and that the technology to prevent collision events has not been developed. Asteroids are not all likely to be monolithic boulders, but a large number are probably rubble piles held together by gravity and cohesion. To protect Earth, we must find ways to alter the trajectories of asteroids so that significant impact events never occur. Controlling smaller asteroids can be done through propulsive methods in proximity operation. However, as all asteroids spin, with some rotating on more than one axis, the thrust vector necessary to deflect an asteroid will likewise rotate. To thrust along the deflection vector for a long period of time, we must first despin the asteroid. This study investigates a novel concept for asteroid despin using spacecraft equipped with neutral beam emitters. While other methods for asteroid control employ vehicles that attach to the body, our proposed method only requires spacecraft to hover above the surface and induce a torque to stabilize the complex spinning behavior of asteroids. As the despin methods will cause considerable stresses inside the rubble pile, we present the maximum stress allowable before asteroid disaggregation due to Drukker-Prager failure calculated from gravitational and van der Waals (VDW) attraction. We provide relations for thrust and Isp as related to neutral beam application. The projected power required for a given beam energy is likewise presented to scale our system and concept. The time required to despin an example asteroid as dependent on force applied is also presented. In order to despin the asteroid to decrease the required power and time to despin, we then consider the possibility of multiple spacecraft working together. While there are several concepts for Earth defense in the event of a probable asteroid impact, most require a precursor mission to determine the size and composition of the asteroid to design systems that latch on or bag the body. Launch opportunities to Near Earth Asteroids can vary anywhere from years to decades making such concepts difficult to implement if there is a limited time frame from discovery to orbital characterization to the likelihood of Earth impact. Our concept requires no such precursor mission as there is no need for direct contact with the asteroid. This work discusses the system-level trades and requirements of an asteroid despin mechanism that shows distinct operational advantages when compared to other designs.",14,,2016,,,,Engineering,"DeCicco, AJ, Hartzell, CM, (2016).

Enhancing momentum coupling reduces the explosive yield needed to achieve a particular orbital alteration, which, in turn, reduces the number of launch vehicles needed while also eliminating (for the HE case) or minimizing radioactive contamination and associated problems. A disadvantage is the additional mass required for the penetrator payload used to bury the explosive in the initial NEO interaction. In computing the momentum coupling necessary to provide reliable estimates of momentum coupling for various target materials (asteroids and comets) three analytic methods are presented for determining the position and yield of buried explosives that can produce a given NEO velocity change, DELTAV. The first method makes use of experimental data on crater ejecta characteristics and relates the momentum of the ejected mass to the yield and placement of the explosive. Ejecta velocities are strongly dependent on target density and scale depth. The second method is based on kinetic energy transfer and determines the change in NEO kinetic energy based on the energy partition from HE or NE detonations. Computational results from this method depend on NEO material properties such as the equation-of-state and mechanical structure. The third method relies on impulse momentum transfer and analyzes the impulsive force generated by the shock and ejecta formation process. Conditions behind the explosively generated shock are exploited to produce accurate computations yielding results comparable to those of the first two methods. Computational results for all three methods are presented to estimate the energy requirement needed to produce in a given NEO the velocity increment DELTAV as a function of asteroid density, radius, ejecta velocity, and explosive depth. All three analytical methods yield consistent numerical results over the range of parameters selected, which includes asteroids with radii from 0.01 to 1 km, densities from 2.2 to 8 g/cm3, and explosive yields from 0.01 to 10(4) kt of TNT. These energy requirements are considerably less than those required to obtain the equivalent DELTAV from stand-off NE devices and, in some cases, eliminate the need for NE entirely.",0,1,1995,10.1016/0094-5765(94)00130-E,,http://doi.org/10.1016/0094-5765(94)00130-E,Engineering,"REMO, JL, SFORZA, PM, (1995).

Near-Earth objects (NEOs) typically end their existence by falling into the Sun. Because the orbit evolution timescale is long, however, it is unlikely that we will witness such events or predict them happening in a foreseeable future. Aims. We studied the orbital dynamics of NEOs to understand whether predictions of Sun impact are possible for individual bodies, and if so, whether special cases can be identified where the Sun impact is expected to happen in less than or similar to 100 ky. Methods. We identified an unusual NEO on a Sun-grazing orbit, 2004 LG, and numerically integrated its orbit to understand its dynamical history and future evolution. Results. We found that the orbit of 2004 LG is strongly affected by the Kozai resonance. In about 9 ky from now, when the orbital eccentricity will reach the maximum value during its current Kozai cycle, 2004 LG has a greater than 25% probability of falling into the Sun. The probability of Sun impact is >50% over the next 100 ky. 2004 LG was exposed to extreme solar radiation in the past and will be exposed to even more extreme solar radiation in the future. For example, we found that 2004 LG was approaching the Sun to within only similar or equal to 5.6 solar radii some 3 ky ago, and its surface was baked at temperatures similar or equal to 2500 K. Spectroscopic observations of 2004 LG would therefore be useful in characterizing the effects of extreme irradiation on NEOs'''' surfaces. Our forward orbital integrations showed that 2004 LG will reach a very low orbital perihelion distance (<1.6 solar radii) at 9 ky from now, indicating its surface will be scorched at temperatures exceeding 4500 K while the interior will be exposed to strong solar tides and thermal stresses. The object will probably not maintain its physical integrity.",34,5,2012,10.1051/0004-6361/201118585,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201118585,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Vokrouhlicky, D, Nesvorny, D, (2012).

Models predict that numerous asteroids should be found on orbits that closely approach the Sun, but few have been seen. In addition, even though the near-Earth-object population in general is an even mix of low-albedo (less than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected) and high-albedo (more than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected) asteroids, the characterized asteroids near the Sun typically have high albedos(4). Here we report a quantitative comparison of actual asteroid detections and a near-Earth-object model (which accounts for observational selection effects). We conclude that the deficit of low-albedo objects near the Sun arises from the super-catastrophic breakup (that is, almost complete disintegration) of a substantial fraction of asteroids when they achieve perihelion distances of a few tens of solar radii. The distance at which destruction occurs is greater for smaller asteroids, and their temperatures during perihelion passages are too low for evaporation to explain their disappearance. Although both bright and dark (high-and low-albedo) asteroids eventually break up, we find that low-albedo asteroids are more likely to be destroyed farther from the Sun, which explains the apparent excess of high-albedo near-Earth objects and suggests that low-albedo asteroids break up more easily as a result of thermal effects.",22,2,2016,10.1038/nature16934,,http://doi.org/10.1038/nature16934,Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Granvik, M, Morbidelli, A, Jedicke, R, Bolin, B, Bottke, WF, Beshore, E, Vokrouhlicky, D, Delbo, M, Michel, P, (2016).

There are many proposed concepts that provide solutions to, either deflect or fragment a PHO over a given amount of time. Each concept has its own advantages and disadvantages. Once a threat is established, an end-to-end PHO mitigation campaign design might include the use of various techniques and multiple phases. The purpose of this survey is to provide useful information to decision makers about the overall effort required to mitigate a threatening object with high reliability. Campaign and mission timelines, launch vehicle(s) and spacecraft, deflection option(s), and resource and technology requirements are some of the considerations that are addressed. A uniform rating scale is established and applied to a number of proposed deflection concepts. Several representative threat scenarios are defined and used to rank proposed deflection concepts based on a set of criteria, such as warning time and technology readiness.

R.",University Strathclyde; University Strathclyde,UK; UK,Near-Earth objects; Near-Earth asteroids; Asteroid deflection; Asteroid exploitation; Space utilization,EARTH; DEFLECTION,"The asteroid and cometary impact hazard has long been recognised as an important issue requiring risk assessment and contingency planning. At the same time asteroids have also been acknowledged as possible sources of raw materials for future large-scale space engineering ventures. This paper explores possible synergies between these two apparently opposed views; planetary protection and space resource exploitation. In particular, the paper assumes a 5 tonne low-thrust spacecraft as a baseline for asteroid deflection and capture (or resource transport) missions. The system is assumed to land on the asteroid and provide a continuous thrust able to modify the orbit of the asteroid according to the mission objective. The paper analyses the capability of such a near-term system to provide both planetary protection and asteroid resources to Earth. Results show that a 5 tonne spacecraft could provide a high level of protection for modest impact hazards: airburst and local damage events (caused by 15-170 m diameter objects). At the same time, the same spacecraft could also be used to transport to bound Earth orbits significant quantities of material through judicious use of orbital dynamics and passively safe aero-capture manoeuvres or low energy ballistic capture. As will be shown, a 5 tonne low-thrust spacecraft could potentially transport between 12 and 350 times its own mass of asteroid resources by means of ballistic capture or aero-capture trajectories that pose very low dynamical pressures on the object.

High-energy beams focused on a threatening asteroid evaporate surface material, creating a reactionary thrust that alters the asteroid''s orbit. The same system could be used to probe an asteroid''s composition, to search for unknown asteroids, and to propel interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft. Phased-array designs are capable of producing high beam intensity, and allow beam steering and beam profile manipulation. Modular designs allow ongoing addition of emitter elements to a growing array. This paper discusses pointing control for extensible laser arrays. Rough pointing is determined by spacecraft attitude control. Lateral movement of the laser emitter tips behind the optical elements provides intermediate pointing adjustment for individual array elements and beam steering. Precision beam steering and beam formation is accomplished by coordinated phase modulation across the array. Added cells are incorporated into the phase control scheme by precise alignment to local mechanical datums using fast, optical relative position sensors. Infrared target sensors are also positioned within the datum scheme, and provide information about the target vector relative to datum coordinates at each emitter. Multiple target sensors allow refined determination of the target normal plane, providing information to the phase controller for each emitter. As emitters and sensors are added, local position data allows accurate prediction of the relative global position of emitters across the array, providing additional constraints to the phase controllers.

Kelley; Rob R. Landis,"Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona; NASA HQ; NASA Johnson Space ctr",USA; USA; USA,,,"Impacts due to near-Earth objects (~90% near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, and ~10% comets) are one of the natural hazards that can pose a great risk to life on Earth, but one that can potentially be mitigated, if the threat is detected with sufficient lead-time. While the probability of such an event is low, the outcome is so catastrophic that we are well justified in investing a modest effort to minimize this threat. Historically, asteroid impacts have altered the course of evolution on the Earth. In 2013 the Chelyabinsk meteor over Russia, which injured over 1600 people and caused ~$30M in damages, reinforced the importance of detecting and characterizing small NEAs that pose a greater threat than most large NEAs discovered so far. The NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) was established to ensure the early detection, tracking and characterization of potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) and is the lead office for providing timely and accurate communications and coordination of U.S. Government planning for response to an actual impact threat. In an effort to test the operational readiness of all entities critical to planetary defense, the NASA PDCO is supporting a community-led exercise. The target of this exercise is 2012 TC4, a 20- meter diameter asteroid that is currently expected to pass by the Earth over Antarctica on Oct. 12, 2017 at a distance of only 2.3 Earth radii. The goal of the TC4 Observing Campaign is to recover, track, and characterize 2012 TC4 as a potential impactor in order to exercise the entire Planetary Defense system from observations, modeling, prediction, and communication. The paper will present an overview of the campaign and summarize early results from the exercise.

The baseline ARM vehicle assumes the use of a 50 kW beginning-of-life solar array which provides a maximum of 40 kW to the electric propulsion system. Launch dates in mid to late 2020 could provide the opportunity for the development and implementation of higher-power solar arrays and electric propulsion systems that are farther along the path to the 100-kW-class systems that could be used to support human missions to Mars. The ARM robotic vehicle conceptual design provides a straightforward approach to increasing the solar array power to similar to 100 kW for the first asteroid redirect mission. Transportation is also a major challenge for harvesting asteroids for the use of their material resources in space. ARM addresses this issue by selecting an asteroid that naturally returns close to Earth and then redirecting it into lunar orbit. Deriving propellants from asteroids is essential to a robust utilization of asteroid material resources. Two elements, magnesium and sulfur, abundantly available in common chondrite asteroids could be used as propellants in Hall thrusters and may be the key to asteroid mining. Finally, ARM has the potential to demonstrate two different planetary defense techniques: an enhanced gravity tractor, or an ion beam deflector. High-power solar electric propulsion (SEP) is needed for both techniques. Simple analyses highlight a clear choice between these options. To obtain the same force and total impulse applied to a potentially hazardous asteroid you can either develop higher power SEP systems for ion beam deflection or you can develop the capability to acquire hundreds of tons of mass from the asteroid for use with a lower power SEP system in an enhanced gravity tractor approach.",11,,2015,,,,Engineering,"Brophy, J., (2015).

Several means to perturb the motion of an asteroid have been discussed in the literature. Attaching a long tether and ballast mass to the asteroid can effectively alter its trajectory. In this paper it is shown that by cutting the tether at an appropriate time the diversion can be enhanced. The instant of cutting the tether significantly affects the final orbit of the asteroid and thus the resulting deflection from the original path.

On average, some 50,000 tons of dust are delivered to our planet every year. While objects smaller than about 30 m mainly disintegrate in the Earth''''s atmosphere, larger ones can penetrate through it and cause damage on the ground. When an object of hundreds of meters in diameter impacts an ocean, a tsunami is created that can devastate coastal cities. Further, if a km-sized object hit the Earth it would cause a global catastrophe due to the transport of enormous amounts of dust and vapour into the atmosphere resulting in a change in the Earth''''s climate. This article gives an overview of the near-Earth asteroid and comet (near-Earth object-NEO) impact hazard and the NEO search programmes which are gathering important data on these objects.

1121,J,ICARUS,t,The asteroid identification problem - II. Target plane confidence boundaries,Article,"Milani, A; Valsecchi, G","Milani, A; Valsecchi, GB",University Pisa,Italy,"asteroids, dynamics; comets, dynamics; impact processes",,"The nominal orbit solution for an asteroid/comet resulting from a least squares fit to astrometric observations is surrounded by a region containing solutions equally compatible with the data, the confidence region. If the observed are is not too short, and for an epoch close to the observations, the confidence region in the six-dimensional space of orbital elements is well approximated by an ellipsoid. This uncertainty of the orbital elements maps to a position uncertainty at close approach, which can be represented on a Modified Target plane (MTP), a modification of the one used by Opik. The MTP is orthogonal to the geocentric velocity at the closest approach point along the nominal orbit. In the linear approximation, the confidence ellipsoids are mapped on the MTP into concentric ellipses, computed by solving the variational equation. For an object observed at only one opposition, however, if the close approach is expected after many revolutions, the ellipses on the MTP become extremely elongated, therefore the linear approximation may fail! and the confidence boundaries on the MTP, by definition the nonlinear images of the confidence ellipsoids, may not be well approximated by the ellipses. In theory the Monte Carlo method by Muinonen and Bowell (1993, Icarus 104, 255-279) can be used to compute the nonlinear confidence boundaries, but in practice the computational load is very heavy. We propose a new method to compute semilinear confidence boundaries on the MTP, based on the theory developed by Milani (1999, Icarus 137, 269-292) to efficiently compute confidence boundaries far predicted observations. This method is a reasonable compromise between reliability and computational load, and can be used for real time risk assessment. These arguments can be applied to any small body approaching any planet, but in the case of a potentially hazardous object (PHO), either an asteroid or a comet whose orbit comes very close to that of the Earth, the application is most important. We apply this technique to discuss the recent case of asteroid 1997 XF(11), which, on the basis of the observations available up to March ii, 1998, appeared to be on an orbit with a near miss of the Earth in 2028. Although the least squares solution had a close approach at 1/8 of the lunar distance, the linear confidence regions corresponding to acceptable size of the residuals are very elongated ellipses which do not include collision; this computation was reported by Chodas and Yeomans. In this paper, we compute the semilinear confidence boundaries and find that they agree with the results of the Monte Carlo method, but differ in a significant way from the linear ellipses, although the differences occur only far from the Earth. The use of the 1930 pre-discovery observations has confirmed the impossibility of an impact in 2028 and reduces the semilinear confidence regions to subsets of the regions computed with less data, as expected. The confidence regions computed using the linear approximation, on the other hand, do not reduce to subsets of the regions computed with less data. We also discuss a simulated example (Bowell and Muinonen 1992, Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 24, 965) of an Earth-impacting asteroid. In this hypothetical case the semilinear confidence boundary has a completely different shape from the linear ellipse, and indeed for orbits determined with only few weeks of observational data the semilinear confidence boundary correctly includes possible collisions, while the linear one does not. Free software is available now, allowing everyone to compute target plane confidence boundaries as in this paper; in case a new asteroid with worrisome close approaches is discovered, our method allows to quickly perform an accurate risk assessment.

The effectiveness of each technology depends on several characteristics of the given object, including its orbit and size. The distribution of these parameters in the likely population of Earth impacting objects can thus determine which of the technologies are most likely to be useful in preventing a collision with the Earth. None of the proposed deflection technologies has been developed and fully tested in space. Developing every proposed technology is currently prohibitively expensive, so determining now which technologies are most likely to be effective would allow us to prioritize a subset of proposed deflection technologies for funding and development. We present a new model, the Deflector Selector, that takes as its input the characteristics of a hazardous object or population of such objects and predicts which technology would be able to perform a successful deflection. The model consists of a machine-learning algorithm trained on data produced by N-body integrations simulating the deflections.

The impact probability distribution of 69 potentially threatening NEOs from these lists that produce 261 dynamically distinct impact instances, or Virtual Impactors (VIs), were calculated using the Asteroid Risk Mitigation and Optimization Research (ARMOR) tool in conjunction with OrbFit. ARMOR projected the impact probability of each VI onto the surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection considers orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. The method of ARMOR is introduced and the tool is validated against two asteroid-Earth collision cases with objects 2008 TO and 2014 AA. In the analysis, the natural distribution of impact corridors is contrasted against the impact probability distribution to evaluate the distributions'''' conformity with the uniform impact distribution assumption. The distribution of impact corridors is based on the NEO population and orbital mechanics. The analysis shows that the distribution of impact corridors matches the common assumption of uniform impact distribution and the result extends the evidence base for the uniform assumption from qualitative analysis of historic impact events into the future in a quantitative way. This finding is confirmed in a parallel analysis of impact points belonging to a synthetic population of 10,006 VIs. Taking into account the impact probabilities introduced significant variation into the results and the impact probability distribution, consequently, deviates markedly from uniformity. The concept of impact probabilities is a product of the asteroid observation and orbit determination technique and, thus, represents a man-made component that is largely disconnected from natural processes. It is important to consider impact probabilities because such information represents the best estimate of where an impact might occur. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We describe the historical development of digest2 and demonstrate its use on real and synthetic data. We find that digest2 can accurately and precisely distinguish NEOs from non-NEOs. At the time of detection, 14% of NEO tracklets and 98.5% of non-NEOs tracklets have D2 below the critical value of D-2 = 65.94% of our simulated NEOs achieved the maximum D-2 = 100% and 99.6% of NEOs achieved D-2 >= 65 at least once during the simulated 10-year timeframe.

Here we present the discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 mu m bands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the 4.5 mu m but not in the 3.6 mu m band, which is consistent with molecular band emission from CO2. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on Don Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4(-0.4)(+0.3) km and an albedo of 0.03(-0.01)(+0.02), which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO. We derive an upper limit on the dust production rate of 1.9 kg s(-1) and derive a CO2 gas production rate of (1.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(26) molecules s(-1). Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic observations indicate the presence of fine-grained silicates, perhaps pyroxene rich, on the surface of Don Quixote.

Understanding the outcome of an impact into regolith layers of different properties is especially important for NASA''''s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and ESA''''s Hera missions. Here we used the iSALE shock physics code to simulate the DART impact into three different target scenarios in the strength regime: a homogeneous porous half-space; layered targets with a. porous weak layer overlying a stronger bedrock; and targets with exponentially decreasing porosity with depth. For each scenario we determined the sensitivity of crater morphology, ejecta mass-velocity distribution and momentum transferred from the impact for deflection, beta - 1, to target properties and structure. We found that for a homogeneous porous half-space, cohesion and porosity play a significant role and the DART impact is expected to produce beta - 1 between 1 and 3. In a two-layer target scenario, the presence of a less porous, stronger lower layer close to the surface can cause both amplification and reduction of ejected mass and momentum relative to the homogeneous upper-layer case. For the case of DART, the momentum enhancement can change by up to 90%. Impacts into targets with an exponentially decreasing porosity with depth only produced an enhancement in the ejected mass and momentum for sharp decreases in porosity that occur within 6 m of the asteroid surface. Together with measurements of the DART crater by the Hera mission, these results can be used to test the predictive capabilities of numerical models of asteroid deflection.",74,1,2020,10.1016/j.pss.2019.104756,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2019.104756,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Raducan, SD, Davison, TM, Collins, GS, (2020).

Miguel; DeWeese, Keith D.; Brophy, John R.",CALTECH; Ai Solut Inc; NASA; CALTECH; NASA; CALTECH,USA; USA; USA; USA; USA; USA,,,"Electric propulsion may play a crucial role in the implementation of the gravity tractor planetary defense technique. Gravity tractors were devised to take advantage of the mutual gravitational force between a spacecraft flying in formation with the target celestial body to slowly alter the celestial body''s trajectory. No physical contact is necessary, which bypasses issues associated with surface contact such as landing, anchoring, or spin compensation. The gravity tractor maneuver can take several forms, from the originally proposed constant thrust in-line hover to the offset halo orbit. Both can be enhanced with the collection of mass at the asteroid. The form of the gravity tractor ultimately impacts the required thrust magnitude to maintain the formation, as well as constraints on the vectoring of the thrust direction. Solar electric propulsion systems provide an efficient mechanism for tugging the spacecraft-asteroid system due to their high specific impulse. Electric propulsion systems can generate thrust continuously at high efficiency, which is an ideal property for gravity tractors that may require years of operation to achieve the desired deflection because of the very low coupling force provided by the gravitational attraction. The performance and feasibility of the deflection are predicated on having the propulsion capability to maintain the gravity tractor. This paper describes the impacts of constraining the solar electric propulsion thrust magnitude and thrust vectoring capability. It is shown that uncertainty in asteroid density and size, when combined with the enforcement of the electric propulsion constraints, can preclude the feasibility of certain gravity tractor configurations. Additionally, odd thruster configurations are shown to drive the gimbal performance and to have major impacts on eroding incident spacecraft surfaces due to plume interaction. ctr of gravity movement further exacerbates issues with gimbaling and plume interaction. A tighter plume divergence angle is therefore always desired, but this paper shows that there is an optimal momentum balance between plume interaction and asteroid-plume avoidance. Several gravity tractor techniques are compared based on metrics of time efficacy, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit time, and mass efficiency, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit mass of fuel. Given the propulsion constraints, halo orbits can be infeasible for smaller asteroids unless the mass of the spacecraft is augmented with collected material through a technique called the Enhanced Gravity Tractor. Another proposed method is to alter the halo period by canting the thrusters. In-line hover gravity tractors can always be moved along the net thrust direction to conform to the given propulsion system at the expense of performance, except in the case of smaller asteroids with propulsion systems that are limited in lower throttle range or maximum gimbal angle. Alternative strategies, such as on-off pulsing the thrusters to lower the effective thrust are considered. An example is described for deflecting asteroid 2008 EV5 (341843), which currently serves as the reference asteroid for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission.",11,,2017,,,,Engineering,"Johnson, SC, Pini, AJ, Reeves, DM, San Martin, AM, DeWeese, KD, and Brophy, JR, (2017).

Its orbital properties have been associated with meteor showers, and its modeled orbital evolution is chaotic, a property which might indicate a history related to comets. Telescopic observations of its visible and near-infrared spectral reflectance, broad-band visible and near-infrared photometry, infrared radiometric measurements, and radar echoes are reponed here from two apparitions, 1979 and 1983. A look at all available observational data shows that this asteroid has a high radiometric albedo, a property not associated with comet nuclei. In certain wavelength regimes it is classified as an S-type asteroid, in others, an E-type, but its overall spectral reflectance is not typical of either taxonomic type, and neither type is thought of as cometlike. Unexpectedly high ultraviolet reflectance at the 1979 apparition was suggested to be the result of residual outgassing as in a comet. The UV photometric data are modeled as fluorescent emission from neutral species found in comets. The resulting calculations indicate a plausible value for OH and CN emission at 0.3085 and 0.38 mum relative to the observed range of active comets. Observations to monitor photometric variations and to search for gaseous activity using observational techniques designed specifically for this purpose were planned and executed in October 1992 to verify or refute the interpretations presented here.",57,2,1993,10.1029/92JE01895,,http://doi.org/10.1029/92JE01895,Geochemistry & Geophysics,"MCFADDEN, LA, COCHRAN, AL, BARKER, ES, CRUIKSHANK, DP, and HARTMANN, WK, (1993).

Additionally, NBAC can be used to modify both the spin state and trajectory of an asteroid. In this work, we study NBAC''s ability to de-spin and/or deflect an asteroid, considering a range of asteroid sizes, asteroid spectral types and assuming the asteroid''s orbit is that of the hypothetical asteroid 2017 PDC. The analysis assumes that four NBAC-equipped spacecraft are deployed, each with a 10 keV neutral beam emitter. The achieved deflection and the applicability of NBAC to a deflection campaign is presented. This work quantifies the impact of uncertainty in asteroid composition on propellant and deflection time requirements for NBAC. Assuming one perihelion passage prior to Earth-impact, NBAC can successfully deflect a 100-150 m S, C, B, or Xc-type asteroid on the 2017 PDC trajectory. Loss of a spacecraft during deflection and its effect on mission success is also investigated. Failure of one or two (of the four) NBAC-carrying spacecraft during deflection does not preclude successful deflection for a set of sizes and densities. Propellant usage and time required to fully de-spin representative asteroids are also presented. Additionally, the time required for total de-spin is compared to the time required for partial arrest. Partial arrest of unstable spinners is possible under mission constraints for a range of asteroid sizes and densities. Total arrest can be achieved for less than 60 kg per spacecraft for a four-spacecraft NBAC system.",39,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.03.057,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.03.057,Engineering,"DeCicco, AJ, Hartzell, CM, Adams, RB, and Polzin, KA, (2019).

A routine monitoring program at NASA''''s Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impacts since 2006. A selection of 126 flashes recorded during periods of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date. Standard CCD photometric techniques were applied to the video and the luminous energy, kinetic energy, and mass are estimated for each impactor. Shower associations were determined for most of the impactors and a range of luminous efficiencies was considered. The flux to a limiting energy of 2.5 x 10(-6) kT TNT or 1.05 x 10(7) J is 1.03 x 10(-7) km(-2) h(-1) and the flux to a limiting mass of 30 g is 6.14 x 10(-1) m(-2) yr(-1) at the Moon. Comparisons made with measurements and models of the meteoroid population indicate that the flux of objects in this size range is slightly lower (but within the error bars) than flux at this size from the power law distribution determined for the near Earth object and fireball population by Brown et al. (Brown, P.G., Spalding, R., ReVelle, D., Tagliaferri, E., Worden, S. [2002]. Nature 420, 294-296).

While the frequency of impacts is reasonably well understood on geologic timescales, it is difficult to predict the next sizeable impact on human timescales by extrapolation from population statistics alone. Fortunately, by identifying and tracking individual objects, we can make precise predictions of any potential close encounters with Earth. As more advance notice is provided, the range of possible mitigation options expands. While the chance of an impact is very small, the potential consequences can be severe, meaning that sensible risk reduction measures should be undertaken. By implementing surveys, the risk of an unforeseen impact can be greatly reduced: the first step is finding the objects. Fortunately, the worldwide community of professional and amateur astronomers has made significant progress in discovering large near-Earth objects (NEOs). More than 95% of NEOs capable of causing global devastation (objects larger than similar to 1km in diameter) have been discovered, and none of these pose an impact hazard in the near future. Infrastructure is in place to link observations and compute close approaches in real time. Interagency and international collaborations have been undertaken to strengthen cooperative efforts to plan potential mitigation and civil defense campaigns. Yet much remains to be done. Approximately 70% of NEOs larger than 140m (large enough to cause severe regional damage) remain undiscovered. With the existing surveys, it will take decades to identify the rest. Progress can be accelerated by undertaking new surveys with improved sensitivity. Plain Language Summary Asteroids and comets have impacted Earth in the past and will do so in the future. Fortunately, by identifying and tracking them, we have the ability to predict any potential close encounters with Earth. By observing the sky repeatedly to search for near-Earth objects, the risk of an unforeseen impact can be greatly reduced; the first step is finding them. While much progress has been made by the astronomical community, much work remains to be done. About 70% of the near-Earth objects large enough to cause severe regional damage have yet to be discovered. Without investment in advanced search systems, it will take many decades to find these objects. While the chance of an impact is small, the consequences can potentially be severe, so reasonable measures (such as finding, tracking, and characterizing the asteroids) should be undertaken.",28,4,2017,10.1002/2017JE005318,,http://doi.org/10.1002/2017JE005318,Geochemistry & Geophysics,"Mainzer, A, (2017).

In order to construct an optimal pointing strategy for NEOSSat, we needed more detailed information in the a < 1.0 AU region than the best current model (Bottke, W.F., Morbidelli, A., Jedicke, R., Petit, J.M., Levison, H.F., Michel, P., Metcalfe, T.S.

We present here the NEOSSat-1.0 NEO orbital distribution model with larger statistics that permit finer resolution and less uncertainty, especially in the a < 1.0 AU region. We find that Amors = 30.1 +/- 0.8%, Apollos = 63.3 +/- 0.4%, Atens = 5.0 +/- 0.3%, Atiras (0.718 < Q < 0.983 AU) = 1.38 +/- 0.04%, and Vatiras (0.307 < Q < 0.718 AU) = 0.22 (103% of the steady-state NEO population. Vatiras are a previously undiscussed NEO population clearly defined in our integrations, whose orbits lie completely interior to that of Venus. Our integrations also uncovered the unexpected production of retrograde orbits from main-belt asteroid sources; this retrograde NEA population makes up similar or equal to 0.1% of the steady-state NEO population. The relative NEO impact rate onto Mercury, Venus, and Earth, as well as the normalized distribution of impact speeds, was calculated from the NEOSSat-1.0 orbital model under the assumption of a steady-state.

Today they experience ongoing processes, some of which are shared with larger bodies but some of which are unique to their size regime. They are critical to humanity''s future as potential threats, resource sites, and targets for human visitation. However, over twenty years since the first spacecraft encounters with asteroids, they remain poorly understood. The mission we propose here, the Main-belt Asteroid and NEO Tour with Imaging and Spectroscopy (MANTIS), explores the diversity of asteroids to understand our solar system''s past history, its present processes, and future opportunities and hazards. MANTIS addresses many of NASA''s highest priorities as laid out in its 2014 Science Plan and provides additional benefit to the Planetary Defense and Human Exploration communities via a low-risk, cost-effective tour of the near-Earth region and inner asteroid belt. MANTIS would visit the materials that witnessed solar system formation and its earliest history, addressing the NASA goal of exploring and observing the objects in the solar system to understand how they formed and evolve. MANTIS measures OH, water, and organic materials via several complementary techniques, visiting and sampling objects known to have hydrated minerals and addressing the NASA goal of improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth. The trajectory designed for MANTIS in 2014 enabled study of the geology and geophysics of nine diverse asteroids, with compositions ranging from water-rich to metallic, representatives of both binary and nonbinary asteroids, and sizes covering over two orders of magnitude, providing unique information about the chemical and physical processes shaping the asteroids, addressing the NASA goal of advancing the understanding of how the chemical and physical processes in our solar system operate, interact, and evolve. Finally, the set of measurements carried out by MANTIS at near-Earth and mainbelt asteroids will by definition characterize objects in the solar system that pose threats to Earth or offer resources for human exploration, a final goal in the NASA Science Plan. MANTIS would revolutionize our understanding of asteroids through its state-of-the-art payload of complementary instruments: A powerful infrared imaging spectrometer and narrow angle camera, both with recent flight heritage, an innovative dust analyzer with the potential for paradigm-shifting discoveries during and between asteroid encounters, and a capable mid-IR imager, potentially the first ever brought to a small body. MANTIS obtains datasets at each target that can be readily intercompared with one another, effectively doubling the current sample of asteroids visited by spacecraft. The MANTIS team is composed of leading international experts in asteroid science, led by PI Andrew Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and Deputy PI Barbara Cohen of the NASA Marshall Space Flight ctr (MSFC).

When it was first detected about 20 h before impact, 2008 TC3 was still farther away than the Moon. Once it was recognized as an impactor and announced as such, 2008 TC3 began to receive considerable attention from astronomical observers. Using the unprecedented dataset of nearly 900 astrometric observations and the latest observation debiasing and weighting techniques, we estimate the precise trajectory of 2008 TC3 and its impact ground track. At the entry point into the atmosphere, the 3-sigma formal uncertainty in predicted position is an ellipse only 1.4 km x 0.15 km in size. The locations of the many meteorites recovered from the desert floor mark the asteroid''s actual ground track and provide a unique opportunity to validate trajectory models. We find that the second-order zonal harmonics of the Earth gravity field moves the ground track by more than 1 km and the location along the ground track by more than 2 km, while non-zonal and higher order harmonics change the impact prediction by less than 20 m. The contribution of atmospheric drag to the trajectory of 2008 TC3 is similar to the numerical integration error level, a few meters, down to an altitude of 50 km. Integrating forward to lower altitudes and ignoring the break-up of 2008 TC3, atmospheric drag causes an along -track deviation that can be as large as a few kilometers at sea level.

The beam can be generated with state-of-the art ion engines from a hovering spacecraft with no need for physical attachment or gravitational interaction with the celestial body. The spacecraft, placed at a distance of a few asteroid diameters, would need an ion thruster pointed at the asteroid surface as well as a second propulsion system to compensate for the ion engine reaction and keep the distance between the asteroid and the shepherd satellite constant throughout the deflection phase. A comparison in terms of required spacecraft mass per total imparted deflection impulse shows that the method outperforms the gravity tractor concept by more than one order of magnitude for asteroids up to about 200 m diameter. The two methods would yield comparable performance for asteroids larger than about 2 km. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We empirically estimate an expected upper limit to the false detection rate in LSST image differencing, using measurements on DECam data and prototype LSST software and find it to be about 450 deg(-2). We show that this rate is already tractable with current prototype of the LSST Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) by processing a 30-day simulation consistent with measured false detection rates. We proceed to evaluate the performance of the LSST baseline survey strategy for PHAs and NEOs using a high-fidelity simulated survey pointing history. We find that LSST alone, using its baseline survey strategy, will detect 66% of the PHA and 61% of the NEO population objects brighter than H = 22, with the uncertainty in the estimate of +/- 5 percentage points. By generating and examining variations on the baseline survey strategy, we show it is possible to further improve the discovery yields. In particular, we find that extending the LSST survey by two additional years and doubling the MOPS search window increases the completeness for PHAs to 86% (including those discovered by contemporaneous surveys) without jeopardizing other LSST science goals (77% for NEOs). This equates to reducing the undiscovered population of PHAs by additional 26% (15% for NEOs), relative to the baseline survey. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A significant component of the study will be to assess the survey''s ability to link observations of a single object from among the large numbers of false detections and detections of other objects. We also will explore the survey''s basic performance in terms of fraction of NEOs discovered and cataloged, both for the planned baseline survey, but also for enhanced surveys that are more carefully tuned for NEO search, generally at the expense of other science drivers.

This network is very versatile and is designed to respond rapidly to target of opportunity events and also to perform long term monitoring of slowly changing astronomical phenomena. The global coverage of the network and the apertures of telescope available make LCOGT ideal for follow-up and characterization of Solar System objects (e.g. asteroids, Kuiper Belt Objects, comets, Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)) and additionally for the discovery of new objects. We are using the LCOGT network to confirm newly detected NEO candidates produced by the major sky surveys such as Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) and PanSTARRS (PS1&2) and several hundred targets are now being followed per year. An increasing amount of time is being spent to obtain follow-up astrometry and photometry for radar-targeted objects and those on the Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS) or Asteroid Retrieval Mission (ARM) lists in order to improve the orbits, determine the light curves and rotation periods and improve the characterization. This will be extended to obtain more light curves of other NEOs which could be targets. Recent results have included the first period determinations for several of the Goldstone-targeted NEOs.

Additional observational constraints include the numbers of dormant and active nuclei in the near-Earth object (NEO) population and the slope of their size distributions. I show that the cumulative power-law slope (-2.86 to -3.15) of the scattered-disk TNO hot population between 0.2 and 15.4 km effective radius is only weakly dependent on the size-dependence of the otherwise unknown disruption mechanism. Evidently, as JFC nuclei from the scattered disk evolve into the inner Solar System only a fraction achieve dormancy while the vast majority of small nuclei (e.g., primarily those with effective radius <2 km) break-up. The percentage disruption rate appears to be comparable with that of the dynamically distinct Oort cloud and Halley type comets (Levison, H.F., Morbidelli, A., Dones, L., Jedicke, R., Wiegert, P.A., Bottke Jr., W.F. [2002]. Science 296, 2212-2215) suggesting that all types of comet nuclei may have similar structural characteristics even though they may have different source regions and thermal histories. The typical disruption rate for a 1 km radius active nucleus is 5 x 10-5 disruptions/year and the dormancy rate is typically 3 times less. We also estimate that average fragmentation rates range from 0.01 to 0.04 events/year/comet, somewhat above the lower limit of 0.01 events/year/comet observed by Chen and Jewitt (Chen, J., Jewitt, D.C.

Adopting the structure function (SF) method, we calculate the SF (delta t = 1 yr) which shows no obvious correlations with the bolometric luminosity, the black hole mass and the Eddington ratio. The ensemble SFs in W1 and W2 bands show that the SF slopes are steeper than those in previous studies which may be caused by different cadence and observational epoch number. We further investigate the relation of variability amplitude sigma(m) between mid-infrared band and optical band, but no obvious correlation is found. No correlation is found between W1-W2 and g - r color. We think that the mid-infrared emission of quasars may be smoothed out by the extended dust distribution, thus leading to no obvious correlation. For the radio-loud quasar sub-sample, we further analyze the relation between the variability amplitude in the mid-infrared band and the radio luminosity at 6 cm, but no obvious correlations are found, which indicate the mid-infrared emission contributed from the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic jet is very weak.",43,3,2020,10.1088/1674-4527/20/2/21,,http://doi.org/10.1088/1674-4527/20/2/21,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Wang, HT, and Shi, Y, (2020).

We summarize the findings of a simple model of synthetic NEOs to infer the object''''s morphology distribution using the measured distribution of light curve amplitudes. This model suggests that a uniform distribution of axis ratio can reproduce the observed sample. This suggests that the quantity of spherical NEOs (e.g., Bennu) is almost equivalent to the quantity of highly elongated objects (e.g., Itokawa), a result that can be directly tested thanks to shape models from Doppler delay radar imaging analysis.

Much discussion has been devoted to methods of diverting these objects away from Earth through the use of space technology. However, if these efforts are unsuccessful, we would need to implement effective strategies to survive the event, no matter how cataclysmic. To date, disaster management for various impact scenarios has not been addressed (except in novels and Hollywood films). An impact disaster may be many orders of magnitude greater than any disaster the human species has ever experienced. Initially, technology and experience gained in other large-scale disasters will most likely form the foundation of how these impact events will be managed and classified. Given the size and energy of the projectile, the estimated area of damage, and whether impact effects might be localized or global in nature, we can begin to build basic disaster response scenarios, anticipate public health concerns, and formulate questions in need of answers. Questions we must deal with include: what will be required technologically, sociologically, and medically to survive? What types of evacuation plans and warning systems might be required? Capabilities in need of further investigation include: technological protection strategies related to ''''impact winter'''', expanded chemical hazard control methodologies, food storage and production, roles of national governments, and international cooperation. Whatever the magnitude and severity of the event, we must reflect on what we know, what capabilities we can apply, develop or adapt, and seriously investigate what might be done to manage it and survive.

We find that while 10-20% end their lifetimes by striking a terrestrial planet (usually Venus or Earth), more than half end their lives in a Sun-grazing state, and about 15% are ejected from the Solar System. The median lifetime of our (biased) sample is about 10 Myr. We discuss the exchange of these objects between the various orbital classes and observe the creation of orbits entirely interior to that of Earth. A variety of resonant processes operating in the inner Solar System, while not dominant in determining the dynamical lifetimes, are crucial for understanding the orbital distribution. Several dynamical mechanisms exist which are capable of significantly increasing orbital eccentricities and inclinations. In particular, we exhibit important new routes to the Sun-grazing end-state, provided by the nu(5) and nu(2) secular resonances at high eccentricity between a = 1.3 and 1.9 AU. We find no dynamical reason to demand that any significant component of the NEO population must come from a cometary source, although such a contribution cannot be ruled out by this work.

The mission would determine the efficiency of momentum transfer during an impact, and help mature the technology required for a kinetic impactor mission, both of which are important precursors for a future space mission to deflect an asteroid by collisional means in an emergency situation. Most demonstration mission concepts to date are based on changing an asteroid''''s heliocentric orbit and require a reconnaissance spacecraft to measure the very small orbital perturbation due to the impact. Our concept is a low-cost alternative, requiring only a single launch. Taking Itokawa as an example, an estimate of the order of magnitude of the change in the spin period, delta P, with such a mission results in delta P of similar to 4 min (0.5%), which could be detectable by Earth-based observatories. Our preliminary study found that a mission concept in which an impactor produces a change in an asteroid''''s spin rate could provide valuable information for the assessment of the viability of the kinetic impactor asteroid deflection concept. Furthermore, the data gained from the mission would be of great benefit for our understanding of the collisional evolution of asteroids and the physics behind crater and ejecta-cloud development.

A new software package was developed to establish the potential parent bodies of meteoroid streams based on the similarity of their orbits. The analysis of a Northern chi-Orionid fireball observed on 2011 December 6 identified two potential parent bodies: the near-Earth object (NEO) 2002XM35 (previously proposed as the parent of this meteoroid stream) and the more recently discovered potentially hazardous asteroid 2008XM1. The calculation of the evolution of the orbital elements performed by using the Mercury 6 symplectic integrator supports the idea that 2008XM1 is a better parent body. Our data sample was expanded by including also in the calculations the mean orbit of the chi-Orionid stream. The results are consistent with the fragmentation of a larger body in the past that could give rise to both NEOs and the Northern chi-Orionid stream. To confirm this, further observations to improve the orbital elements of these asteroids should be attempted before the objects are lost. The analysis of the emission spectrum recorded for this fireball supports a primitive nature for these meteoroids.",40,5,2013,10.1093/mnras/stt342,,http://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt342,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Madiedo, JM, Trigo-Rodriguez, JM, Williams, IP, Ortiz, JL, Cabrera, J, (2013).

The debiased LPC size-frequency distribution is in agreement with previous estimates for large comets with nuclear diameter greater than or similar to 1 km but we measure a significant drop in the SFD slope for small objects with diameters < 1 km and approaching only 100 m diameter. Large objects have a slope alpha(big) = 0.72 +/- 0.09(stat.) +/- 0.15(sys.) while small objects behave as alpha(small) = 0.07 +/- 0.03(stat.) +/- 0.09(sys.) where the SFD is proportional to 10(alpha HN) and H-N represents the cometary nuclear absolute magnitude. The total number of LPCs that are > 1km diameter and have perihelia q < 10 au is 0.46 +/- 0.15 x 10(9) while there are only 2.4 +/- 0.5(stat.) +/- 2(sys.) x 10(9) objects with diameters > 100m due to the shallow slope of the SFD for diameters < 1 km. We estimate that the total number of ''potentially active'' objects with diameters >= 1 km in the Oort cloud, objects that would be defined as LPCs if their perihelia evolved to < 10 au, is (1.5 +/- 1) x 10(12) with a combined mass of 1.3 +/- 0.9 M-circle plus.

The key metric to assess the performance of the laser system is the thrust coupling coefficient which is given by the ratio between thrust and associated optical power. Three different models are developed in the paper: a one dimensional steady state model, a full 3D steady state model and a one dimensional model accounting for transient effects resulting from the tumbling motion of the asteroid. The results obtained with these models are used to derive key requirements and constraints on the laser system that allow approaching the ideal performance in a realistic case. (C) 2016 COSPAR.

The vast majority of Pan-STARRS observations were carried out in a manner well-suited to detection of moving objects-most observations were taken as a sequence of four observations spaced over approximately one hour. Most of the remainder were taken as pairs of observations separated by approximately 20 minutes. Since 2014, the primary purpose of Pan-STARRS has been a search for Near-Earth Objects. During the past 5 years, Pan-STARRS has developed into one of the most powerful surveys of our Solar System, and continues to be one of the leading Near-Earth Object discovery telescopes. Due to the nature of the Pan-STARRS detectors, and the very large area of the focal plane, it has been difficult to find all moving objects, and a large number of moving object detections remain unreported from the 8+ years of surveying the sky north of -50 degrees declination. The Pan-STARRS telescopes and cameras are explained. Examples of how archival observations have improved orbits of important Near-Earth Objects are provided. The performance of the current CCDs is described, and a proposed design for a replacement camera with larger, better performing CCDs is presented. Given the importance of finding hazardous Near-Earth Objects, we believe that PanSTARRS could be much more successful if funding for a replacement camera could be secured.",2,,2019,,,,Engineering,"Wainscoat, RJ, Weryk, R, (2019).

The first of these telescopes, Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), has established itself as the leading Near Earth Object (NEO) discovery telescope, having discovered more that 50 percent of the larger NEOs over the last several years. The second telescope, Pan-STARRS2 (PS2) is being commissioned, and its efficiency will grow as its camera is improved and as its optics and control system are tuned. The Pan-STARRS telescopes deliver excellent astrometry and photometry. PS1 continues to discover a significant number of large (> 1km) NEOs, which are the most dangerous due to their large size. Because of the excellent image quality at Haleakala, the Pan-STARRS telescopes are very efficient at detecting cometary activity. PS1 discovered over half of the new comets in both 2014 and 2015, and discovered 10 comets in 10 nights in November 2014. In good weather conditions, the discovery rate of NEO candidates by PS1 can overwhelm worldwide NEO follow-up resources, particularly for fainter NEOs. This has required PS1 to repeat fields to recover its NEO candidates to produce discoveries. As PS2 matures, and when the G96 telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona is upgraded, the combination of these three telescopes will facilitate a higher NEO discovery rate, and a better census of the NEOs in the sky. This will in turn lead to a better understanding of the size and orbit distribution of NEOs, and the corresponding hazard to Earth.",4,,2016,,,,Engineering,"Wainscoat, R, (2016).

However, the call for action in an exceptional situation that uses scientific knowledge to rationalize exceptional political decisions is an obvious target for criticism by critical security studies scholars. The following article offers a policy framework to avoid the inevitable harsh criticism when any planetary defense policy is thoughtfully designed. The aim is to bring knowledge from political science and international relations theory to the planetary defense community to help build the future planetary defense political and technical architecture that will be desirable, feasible and will sustain. The article argues that it must be ethically desirable for involved actors, politically feasible in the current international system and sustainable in the long-term for the sake of humankind survival and prosperity. The theoretical approach reflects realistic dynamics between nation states but also proposes more visionary cosmopolitan future of humankind; it introduces ethical security studies to argue why, when and how planetary defense can be ethical but also derives from neoliberal thought to propose a policy of technological interdependence. The article combines critical reflections of current technical proposals, anticipate the criticism and proposes the least complicated way through the maze of international relations. The planetary defense has potential to unite people around the world in the Ulrich Beck''s cosmopolitan vision, but it must take into consideration that rational solutions focused on effectivity enabled by engineered technology do not necessarily bring the desirable future.",57,3,2019,10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.037,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.06.037,Engineering,"Schmidt, N, (2019).

The steady-state NES size-frequency and residence-time distributions were determined under the dynamical influence of all the massive bodies in the Solar System (but mainly the Sun. Earth, and Moon) for NEOs of negligible mass. To this end, we compute the NES capture probability from the NEO population as a function of the latter''s heliocentric orbital elements and combine those results with the current best estimates for the NEO size-frequency and orbital distribution. At any given time there should be at least one NES of 1-m diameter orbiting the Earth. The average temporarily-captured orbiter (TCO; an object that makes at least one revolution around the Earth in a co-rotating coordinate system) completes (2.88 +/- 0.82) rev around the Earth during a capture event that lasts (286 +/- 18) d. We find a small preference for capture events starting in either January or July. Our results are consistent with the single known natural TCO, 2006 RH120, a few-meter diameter object that was captured for about a year starting in June 2006.

We develop a means to estimate thermal inertia values of asteroids and use it to show that thermal inertia appears to increase with spin period in the case of main-belt asteroids (MBAs). Similar behavior is found on the basis of thermophysical modeling for near-Earth objects (NEOs). We interpret our results in terms of rapidly increasing material density and thermal conductivity with depth, and provide evidence that thermal inertia increases by factors of 10 (MBAs) to 20 (NEOs) within a depth of just 10 cm. Our results are consistent with a very general picture of rapidly changing material properties in the topmost regolith layers of asteroids and have important implications for calculations of the Yarkovsky effect, including its perturbation of the orbits of potentially hazardous objects and those of asteroid family members after the break-up event. Evidence of a rapid increase of thermal inertia with depth is also an important result for studies of the ejectaenhanced momentum transfer of impacting vehicles (''kinetic impactors''') in planetary defense.'""""",43,12,2016,10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/127,,http://doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/127,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Harris, AW, Drube, L, (2016).

The difference being that nearly all of the energy content of ionizing radiation is converted to heat but only 40-50% of the energy content of ionizing radiation is converted into ions and excited states. Conversion of the energy contained in ionizing radiation into ions and excited states starts out at a considerable disadvantage. Nuclear-pumped lasers have typically depended on the conversion of ionizing radiation into ions and excited states as a first step. Among the reasons that nuclear-pumped lasers have had low system efficiencies (1-2.5%) is the considerable inefficiencies in producing ions and excited states from ionizing radiation. A nuclear-pumped laser system which uses heat produced from the energy content of ionizing radiation as the driver for the laser system is described in this paper. The conversion of heat into vibrational states in molecular nitrogen allows energy to be stored in a long lived molecular state which can then be transported spatially where its energy is collisionally conveyed to carbon dioxide molecules in a resonance transfer process to produce the carbon dioxide upper laser level. The carbon dioxide laser emits a laser beam with a wavelength centered at 10.4 pm. The nitrogen vibrational state and its resonance conversion into the carbon dioxide upper laser level is one of nature''''s most efficient processes in laser physics (with laser efficiencies approaching similar to 20% primarily being driven by the resonance process-extremely high for a laser). The laser system described here takes advantage of this highly efficient mechanism for conversion of thermal energy to optical energy. The feasibility of using nuclear rocket core technology for the generation of high temperature gas flows to power this thermal to optical conversion process is described. This study indicates that the thermal to optical conversion process can lead to a carbon dioxide laser with efficiencies on the order of 7% or perhaps better. Such a system would have potential applications in power beaming, space propulsion, asteroid mining, asteroid deflection and potential military applications.",85,8,2018,10.1016/j.pnucene.2018.04.008,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnucene.2018.04.008,Nuclear Science & Technology,"Prelas, MA, White, NE, Wisniewski, DA, Walton, KL, Tchouaso, MT, Boraas, MA, Aguilar, FD, Kasiwattanawut, H, Knewtson, TB, Schutte, JR, Watermann, ML, (2018).

Near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) is a potential flyby and rendezvous target for interplanetary missions because of its easy-to-reach orbit. The physical and thermal properties of the asteroid are relevant for establishing the scientific mission goals and also important in the context of near-Earth object studies in general. Aims. Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such as shape, spin-vector, size, geometric albedo, and surface properties of 162173 (1999 JU3). Methods. With three sets of published thermal observations (ground-based N-band, Akari IRC, Spitzer IRS), we applied a thermophysical model to derive the radiometric properties of the asteroid. The calculations were performed for the full range of possible shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the available sample of visual lightcurve observations. Results. The near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) has an effective diameter of 0.87 +/- 0.03 km and a geometric albedo of 0.070 +/- 0.006. The chi(2)-test reveals a strong preference for a retrograde sense of rotation with a spin-axis orientation of lambda(ecl) = 73 degrees, beta(ecl) = -62 degrees and P-sid = 7.63 +/- 0.01 h. The most likely thermal inertia ranges between 200 and 600 Jm(-2) s(-0.5) K-1, about a factor of 2 lower than the value for 25143 Itokawa. This indicates that the surface lies somewhere between a thick-dust regolith and a rock/boulder/cm-sized, gravel-dominated surface like that of 25143 Itokawa. Our analysis represents the first time that shape and spin-vector information has been derived from a combined data set of visual lightcurves (reflected light) and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy (thermal emission).",17,1,2011,10.1051/0004-6361/201015599,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201015599,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Muller, TG, Durech, J, Hasegawa, S, Abe, M, Kawakami, K, Kasuga, T, Kinoshita, D, Kuroda, D, Urakawa, S, Okumura, S, Sarugaku, Y, Miyasaka, S, Takagi, Y, Weissman, PR, Choi, YJ, Larson, S, Yanagisawa, K, Nagayama, S, (2011).

During impact crater formation the ballistic ejection of material out of the crater is a major process, which holds significance for an impact study into the deflection of asteroids. In this study we numerically simulate impacts into low-gravity, strength dominated asteroid surfaces using the iSALE shock physics code, and consider the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission as a case study. We find that target cohesion, initial porosity, and internal friction coefficient greatly influence ejecta mass/velocity/launch-position distributions and hence the amount by which an asteroid can be deflected. Our results show that as the cohesion is decreased the ratio of ejected momentum to impactor momentum, beta - 1, increases; beta - 1 also increases as the initial porosity and internal friction coefficient of the asteroid surface decrease. Using nominal impactor parameters and reasonable estimates for the material properties of the Didymos binary asteroid, the DART target, our simulations show that the ejecta produced from the impact can enhance the deflection by a factor of 2 to 4. We use numerical impact simulations that replicate conditions in several laboratory experiments to demonstrate that our approach to quantify ejecta properties is consistent with impact experiments in analogous materials. Finally, we investigate the self-consistency between the crater size and ejection speed scaling relationships previously derived from the point-source approximation for impacts into the same target material.",70,9,2019,10.1016/j.icarus.2019.03.040,,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.03.040,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Raducan, SD, Davison, TM, Luther, R, Collins, GS, (2019).

Hayabusa2 is the successor of Hayabusa, which returned samples from the asteroid Itokawa to the Earth. Although the design of Hayabusa2 follows that of Hayabusa, the former is equipped with some new components. The small carry-on impactor (SCI) is one of those components. The SCI is a compact kinetic impactor designed to remove the asteroid surface regolith locally and create an artificial crater. One of the most important scientific objectives of Hayabusa2 is to investigate the chemical and physical properties of the internal materials and structures of the target body, asteroid Ryugu. Hayabusa2 will attempt to observe the resultant crater with some scientific instruments and to get samples from around the crater. High kinetic energy is required to create a meaningful crater, however, the impact system design needs to fit within strict constraints. Complicated functions, such as a guidance and control system, are not permitted. A special type of shaped charge is used for the acceleration of the impactor of the SCI in order to make system simpler. Using this explosion technique makes it possible to accelerate the impactor very quickly and to hit the asteroid without a guidance system. However, the impact operation will be complicated because the explosive is very powerful and it scatters high-speed debris at the detonation. This paper describes an overview of the SCI system, the results of the development testing and an outline of the impact experiment of the Hayabusa2 mission.",21,7,2017,10.1007/s11214-016-0297-5,,http://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-016-0297-5,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Saiki, T., Imamura, H., Arakawa, M., Wada, K., Takagi, Y., Hayakawa, M., Shirai, K., Yano, H. and Okamoto, C., 2016.

In comparison with the quiescent state, the infrared flux is brightened by 0.12 and 0.16 mag in the W1 (3.4 mu m) and W2 (4.6 mu m) bands at 36 days after the optical discovery (or similar to 110 days after the peak disruption date). The flux excess is still detectable similar to 170 days later. Assuming that the flare-like infrared emission is from the dust around the black hole, its blackbody temperature is estimated to be similar to 2.1 x 10(3) K, slightly higher than the dust sublimation temperature, indicating that the dust is likely located close to the dust sublimation radius. The equilibrium between the heating and radiation of the dust claims a bolometric luminosity of similar to 10(43) - 10(45) erg s(-1), comparable with the observed peak luminosity.

We summarize the findings of a simple model of synthetic NEOs to infer the object''s morphology distribution using the measured distribution of light curve amplitudes. This model suggests that a uniform distribution of axis ratio can reproduce the observed sample. This suggests that the quantity of spherical NEOs (e.g., Bennu) is almost equivalent to the quantity of highly elongated objects (e.g., Itokawa), a result that can be directly tested thanks to shape models from Doppler delay radar imaging analysis.

The conference proceedings established the scientific basis for an international organizational framework to support research and collective actions to mitigate a potential near-Earth object (NEO) threat to the planet. Since that time, researchers have conducted telescope surveys that should, within the coming decade, answer many questions about the size, number, and Earth impact probability of these objects. Space explorations to asteroids and comets have been successfully carried out, including sample recovery. Laboratory experiments and computer simulations at Sandia National Laboratories have analyzed the effects of high-energy-density soft x-ray radiation on meteorites-which might help researchers develop a way to redirect an incoming asteroid by vaporizing a thin layer of its surface. An Action Team on NEOs, established in 2001 in response to recommendations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, identified the primary components of NEO mitigation and emphasized the value of finding potentially hazardous NEOs as soon as possible. Recommendations from the action team are meant to ensure that all nations are aware of the NEO danger, and to coordinate mitigation activities among nations that could be affected by an impact, as well as those that might play an active role in any eventual deflection or disruption campaign.",22,7,2014,10.1177/0096340214539125,,http://doi.org/10.1177/0096340214539125,International Relations; Social Issues,"Remo, J. and Haubold, H., 2014.

We propose an orbital planetary defense system capable of heating the surface of potentially hazardous objects to the vaporization point as a feasible approach to impact risk mitigation. We call the system DE-STAR, for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation. The DE-STAR is a modular-phased array of kilowatt class lasers powered by photovoltaic''s. Modular design allows for incremental development, minimizing risk, and allowing for technological codevelopment. An orbiting structure would be developed in stages. The main objective of the DE-STAR is to use focused directed energy to raise the surface spot temperature to similar to 3000 K, sufficient to vaporize all known substances. Ejection of evaporated material creates a large reaction force that would alter an asteroid''s orbit. The baseline system is a DE-STAR 3 or 4 (1-to 10-km array) depending on the degree of protection desired. A DE-STAR 4 allows initial engagement beyond 1 AU with a spot temperature sufficient to completely evaporate up to 500-m diameter asteroids in 1 year. Small objects can be diverted with a DE-STAR 2 (100 m) while space debris is vaporized with a DE-STAR 1 (10 m).

The patched-conic approximation is used and the time spent inside the planets'' spheres of influence is neglected. An indirect method is applied to find the trajectory that maximizes the final mass. The procedure provides the boundary conditions for optimality, by considering, in particular, escape from the Earth using a rochet motor which is jettisoned after it has been fired, either a free-height or a minimum-height Earth flyby, and a rendezvous with the target. The boundary value problem that arises from the application of the theory of optimal control is solved using a procedure based on Newton''s method. The search for the best mission opportunity to reach a target during an assigned period is carried out by means of a simple technique that first optimizes the time-free or bit transfer, that is, the insertion of the spacecraft into the same geometrical orbit as the target. Numerical results confirm that, in the meantime before a high-thrust and high specific-impulse engine is available to leave the Earth, this kind of mission is very efficient in reaching near Earth objects.",16,,2000,,,,Engineering,"Colasurdo, G, and Casalino, L, (2000).

DART represents a component of a joint NASA-ESA mission to study near Earth object kinetic impact deflection. The DART trajectory must satisfy mission objectives for arrival timing, geometry, and lighting while minimizing launch vehicle and spacecraft propellant requirements. Chemical propulsion trajectories are feasible from two candidate launch windows in late 2020 and 2021. The 2020 trajectories are highly perturbed by Earth''s orbit, requiring post-launch deep space maneuvers to retarget the Didymos system. Within these windows, opportunities exist for flybys of additional near Earth objects: Orpheus in 2021 or 2007 YJ in 2022. A second impact attempt, in the event that the first impact is unsuccessful, can be added at the expense of a shorter launch window and increased (similar to 3x) spacecraft Delta V. However, the second impact arrival geometry has poor lighting, high Earth ranges, and would require additional degrees of freedom for solar panel and/or antenna gimbals. A low-thrust spacecraft configuration increases the trajectory flexibility. A solar electric propulsion spacecraft could be affordably launched as a secondary spacecraft in an Earth orbit and spiral out to target the requisite interplanetary departure condition. A sample solar electric trajectory was constructed from an Earth geostationary transfer using a representative 1.5 kW thruster. The trajectory requires 9 months to depart Earth''s sphere of influence, after which its interplanetary-trajectory includes a flyby of Orpheus and a second Didymos impact attempt The solar electric spacecraft implementation would impose additional bus design constraints, including large solar arrays that could pose challenges for terminal guidance. On the basis of this study, there are many feasible options for DART to meet its mission design objectives and enable this unique kinetic impact experiment. (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The assumption in paper I was that the nucleus model is composed of a mixture of ices of water, CO2, and CO and dust particles; the H2O ice is initially crystalline. In this paper we analyze if the initial status of ice, the presence of CO, and the spin period affect the evolutionary history of the body, and if part of the original material is preserved in the inner part of the nucleus when the comet becomes a short-period comet.

Out of more than 17000 NEA candidates, while the majority became either new discoveries or were associated with previously known objects, about 11% were unable to be followed-up or confirmed. We further demonstrate that of the unconfirmed candidates, 926 +/- 50 are likely to be NEAs, representing 18% of discovered NEAs in that period. Only 11% (similar to 93) of the unconfirmed NEA candidates were large (having absolute magnitude H < 22). To identify the reasons why these NEAs were not recovered, we analyzed those from the most prolific asteroid surveys: Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Space Surveillance Telescope. We examined the influence of plane-of-sky positions and rates of motion, brightnesses, submission delays, and computed absolute magnitudes, as well as correlations with the phase of the moon and seasonal effects. We find that delayed submission of newly discovered NEA candidate to the NEOCP drove a large fraction of the unconfirmed NEA candidates. A high rate of motion was another significant contributing factor. We suggest that prompt submission of suspected NEA discoveries and rapid response to fast-moving targets and targets with fast growing ephemeris uncertainty would allow better coordination among dedicated follow-up observers, decrease the number of unconfirmed NEA candidates, and increase the discovery rate of NEAs.",30,7,2018,10.3847/1538-3881/aac37d,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aac37d,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Veres, P, Payne, MJ, Holman, MJ, Farnocchia, D, Williams, GV, Keys, S, and Boardman, I, (2018).

This paper proposes a way of changing the orbit of the asteroid to avoid an impact. A solar sail evolving in an H-reversal trajectory is utilized for asteroid deflection. Firstly, the dynamics of the solar sail and the characteristics of the H-reversal trajectory are analyzed. Then, the attitude of the solar sail is optimized to guide the sail to impact the target asteroid along an H-reversal trajectory. The impact velocity depends on two important parameters: the minimum solar distance along the trajectory and lightness number of the solar sail.

Dempster shafer theory of evidence (DST), which merges interval-based and probabilistic uncertainty modeling, is used in the robust optimization. The robust optimization method optimizes the performance while at the same time maximizing its belief value. A population based multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm based on a steepest descent like strategy with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to search robust Pareto solutions. Analytical and numerical lifetime predictors are used to evaluate the debris lifetime after the laser pulses. Trust region based fidelity management is designed to reduce the computational cost caused by the expensive model. When the solutions fall into the trust region, the analytical model is used to reduce the computational cost. The proposed robust optimization method is first tested on a set of standard problems and then applied to the removal of Iridium 33 with pulsed lasers. It will be shown that the proposed approach can identify the most robust solutions with minimum lifetime under uncertainty. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The discovery and tracking of 2018 LA marks only the third instance in history that the parent body of a fireball has been identified before its eventual disintegration in our atmosphere. The subsequent recovery of meteorites from 2018 LA was only the second time materials from outer space that reached the ground could be linked with certitude to a particular minor body. However, meteoroids like 2018 LA and its forerunners, 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA, are perhaps fragments of larger members of the near-Earth object (NEO) population. As the processes leading to the production of such fragments are unlikely to spawn just one meteoroid per event, it is important to identify putative siblings and plausible candidates from which the observed meteoroids might have originated. Aims. Here, we study the pre-impact orbital evolution of 2018 LA to place this meteoroid within the dynamical context of other NEOs that follow similar trajectories. Methods. Our statistical analyses are based on the results of direct N-body calculations that use the latest orbit determinations and include perturbations by the eight major planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon system, and the three largest asteroids. A state-of-the-art NEO orbit model was used to interpret our findings and a randomization test was applied to estimate their statistical significance. Results. We find a statistically significant excess of NEOs in 2018 LA-like orbits; among these objects, we find one impactor, 2018 LA, and the fourth closest known passer-by, 2018 UA. A possible connection with the chi-Scorpiids meteor shower is also discussed. The largest known NEO with an orbit similar to that of 2018 LA is the potentially hazardous asteroid (454100) 2013 BO73 and we speculate that they both originate from a common precursor via a collisional cascade. Conclusions. Future spectroscopic observations of 454100 and other NEOs in similar orbits may confirm or deny a possible physical relationship with 2018 LA.",44,1,2019,10.1051/0004-6361/201834313,,http://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201834313,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Marcos, CD, Marcos, RD, (2019).

We present here the first results of the MANOS visible spectroscopic survey. The spectra were obtained from August 2013 to March 2018 at Lowell Observatory''''s Discovery Channel 4.3 m telescope, and both Gemini North and South facilities. In total, 210 NEOs have been observed and taxonomically classified. Our taxonomic distribution shows significant variations with respect to surveys of larger objects. We suspect these to be due to a dependence of Main Belt source regions on object size. Compared to previous surveys of larger objects, we report a lower fraction of S+Q-complex asteroids of 43.8 +/- 4.6%. We associate this decrease with a lack of Phocaea family members at very small size. We also report higher fractions of X-complex and A-type asteroids of 23.8 +/- 3.3% and 3.8 +/- 1.3% respectively due to an increase of Hungaria family objects at small size. We find a strong correlation between the Q/S ratio and perihelion distance. We suggest this correlation is due to planetary close encounters with Venus playing a major role in turning asteroids from S to Q-type. This hypothesis is supported by a similar correlation between the Q/S ratio and Venus MOID.",75,11,2019,10.3847/1538-3881/ab43dd,,http://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab43dd,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Devogele, M., Moskovitz, N., Thirouin, A., Gustaffson, A., Magnuson, M., Thomas, C., Willman, M., Christensen, E., Person, M., Binzel, R., Polishook, D., DeMeo, F., Hinkle, M., Trilling, D., Mommert, M., Burt, B. and Skiff, B., 2019.

Impact-geometry values that account for changes in asteroid orbital energy at an ideal orbital intersection point for the spacecraft and asteroid were investigated. The impact-geometry map is defined as a contour plot of the impact geometry as a function of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the spacecraft. The ideal impact of the spacecraft on the asteroid depends on the shape of the injected orbit, and this is well visualized by the impact-geometry map. In addition, the trajectory optimization of photonic solar sails for fictional kinetic-impactor-mission scenarios was performed and the results with an impact-geometry map were investigated. The results were plotted on the impact-geometry map and well reflect the relationship between achievable deflection distance and impact geometry.

Several studies have been made on asteroid redirection and impact mitigation, however, to this date no mission tested the proposed concepts. An impact study on a representative body allows the measurement of the effects on the target''s orbit and physical structure. With this goal, DART''s objective is to verify the effectiveness of the kinetic impact concept for planetary defense. The spacecraft uses solar electric propulsion to escape Earth, fly by (138971) 2001 CB21 for impact rehearsal, and impact Didymos-B, the secondary body of the binary (65803) Didymos system. This work focuses on the heliocentric transfer design part of the mission with the validation of the baseline trajectory, performance comparison to other mission objectives, and assessment of the baseline robustness to missed thrust events. Results show a good performance of the selected trajectory for different mission objectives: latest possible escape date, maximum kinetic energy on impact, shortest possible time of flight, and use of an Earth swing-by. The baseline trajectory was shown to be robust to a missed thrust with 1% of fuel margin being enough to recover the mission for failures of more than 14 days.",,2,2017,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170001436.pdf,,"Sarli, B.V., Ozimek, M.T., Atchison, J.A., Englander, J.A. and Barbee, B.W., 2017.
